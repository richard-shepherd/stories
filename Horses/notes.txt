- Can we "make this world a paradise"?
  - What is Paradise?
    - The ability to live in the moment, without worry
    - So everything needs to be provided and safe
    - That's why God is the ultimate father - providing security
      - Is being a "child" demeaning? 
        - Not really. It's what we realy want.
  

- What's so wrong with death?
  - You do not feel fear for the time before you were born when you did not exist, so 
    why fear the time after your death?
  - In the same way, the world was no worse when it contained 1bn people, or
    100m people than when it contains 10bn people.
    - Except that it could not produce as much. But with the robots it can.

- Need a name for the robots.
  - Not explained - but a name that implies them. Like "synths" (but better!)

- Radically small population?
  - Say 100,000
  - A much more comfortable number

- Not enough diversity?
  - Who actually wants diversity anyway?

- They want to have short lives
  - Well, "normal" short lives
  - Need to think ofa good reason for this!

- Short lives, but better people

- With fewer people, it is important that the ones there are are good ones
  - Meaning good *quality*.
  - So breeding / eugenics

- Protagonist is Jewish
  - Silicon Valley "disruptor"
  - Disrupting the consensus about welfare, population etc.
  - Promoting a Green alternative? (too glib?)
    - Maybe just a side note, or an excuse.
    - Or used in a TV interview.
      - Like the Diana Brackley interview
      - Just doing for real what other people say they want

- As Jewish he "should know better than anyone what this means"
  - Yes, and the Jewish people have come under an intense "selection-pressure"
  - Already clearly a good base for the future people.

- Breeding / eugenics
  - Everyone knows it is true, but will not admit it.
  - As with dogs, horses etc.

- How will the population reduction be done?
  - Misogynistic internet propoaganda, coupled with VR sex robots.
    - Better than the real thing. Men can't be bothered with women any more.
    - Maybe this doesn't work, as peoplestill want children.
    - Not to mention that some "undesirable" sectors of the population
      actively resist this: fundamentalist Christians and Muslims.
      - Exactly the people the protagonst does not want to form the future population.
      - Maybe this has been tried and failed?
      - Or maybe it has been modelled in a computer simulation, and shown to
        lead to this outcome.

- Protagonst has created a world population computer model
  - To work out the best way to reduce population dramatically.
  - It has all sorts of other amazing abilities (vaguely psycho-historical)
    but the main purpose (or discovered purpose) is population reduction.

- Use the "attempted genocide" line.
  "What you are proposing is 

- Meritocracy
  - Protagonist is silicon valley disruptor
  - "Let's face it. We don't believe that we're the same as everyone else. We're better."
  - "I know it, and you know it. We all know that we're not supposed to say it. But we all know it's true."
  - "I'm just fucked off having to pander to the morons."

- Alliance of Germans and Jews.
  - If it were not for the unfortunate "antagonism" in the past, they
    would together have been an unstoppable genetic combination.

- Protagonist and German wife
  - He chose her by secretly accessing government (healthcare) genetic database.

- Maybe they have a disabled daughter?
  - Down's syndrome
  - This whole debate
  - He still believes his theory despite wanting his daughter to survive and be happy.

- Perhaps he then brings about a world poulated by Down's syndrome people
  - With the robots to look after them
  - Could be the ending?
  - Maybe a tear-jerker?


- Down's syndrome
  - Not always happy
  - But always kind

- Story is a reverse-Fall
  - ie, return to prelapsarian innocence of Down's syndrome

- Danger of being patronizing to Down's people?
  - Have to try to avoid this!

- Father wants the best for his daughter
  - So kills everyone else!

- Targetted sterilization
  - They need a clear genetic marker (said earlier in story)
    - "Racial" differences are too fuzzy
      - As race is a family resemblance style thing
  - By the chromosone

- Eugenics
  - But there is no superior race
  - You have to ask "superior" for what?
  - Even then, a mix of characteristics from different groups could be the best
    - So you have to breed for them
    - Germans and Jews.


- Father (protagonist) himself dies at the end
  - Maybe some sort of problem with the artificial virus?
  - It gets out of hand?
  - It mutates and the antidote stops working
  - He sends his daughter off with the robot
    - Asks her to call it Daddy
    - She says "No, you're my Daddy."
    - "It would make me happy if you could pretend that he's your Daddy. Can you do that for me?
       Just pretend for a while."
    - Girl goes off holding hands with the robot.
      - Door to the bunker closing behind them. Protoganist hears:
      - "What shall we do today, Daddy? Shall we go to the beach?"
      - "Whatever you want, darling."
        - Or maybe instead of "darling" a special endearment used by the real Daddy
        - Used by the robot for the first time in the last line?
        - Foxglove? Sweetpea?

- Father (or others) have made a genetic targetting virus
  - Based on advanced medicines which can target speific genetic diseases.

- Discussion about utilitarianism
  - Liberals assume it (like other things)
  - ie, the more people is better.
    - But why?
    - Why not have 100,000 well off people instead?

- Could the whole thing be a TED talk?
  - The "talk of your life"
  - You betcha!
  - Protagonist discusses the background ideas
    - Abstract at first
    - Then starts to reveal that they were actually planning this
    - Then talks about his daughter
    - She opened his eyes - made him change his mind
    - Made him realise what he could do instead.
    - Talk ends as above

- TED:
  - BUT: how does this work if the disease is it its final stages?
  - Especially if protagonist has been using an antidote
  - Surely the rest of the audience will be very ill
  - PROBLEM:
    - If it is so late in the progress of the disease, why are the audience there?
    - If it is early, then the story cannot end with the end of the talk.
    - BOTHER!

- There is a plague, and people do not know its source
  - Discussion of targetted medicine, targetting specific gene groups
  - That this is only possible with the advent of advanced AIs
    - Maybe discussed in a TED talk?
    - Giving the idea that the AIs are behind the plague

- Plague - inevitable death
  - Relatively painless
  - Gives you time to say goodbye to family
  - Seems engineered to cause the least suffering.

- Protagonist has fairly exteme views
  - ie, exterminate 99+% of the world's population
  - BUT: We should make this seem (at least at first) sympathetic.

- What is the *story*?
  - ie the tension facing the protagonist

- Maybe a radically utilitarian, "rational", atheist government
  - Protagonist is on the run from them
  - Or maybe denounced by them
  - Public opprobrium
  - Boycott of his products
  - Death threats
    - Protagonost not supported by the government
    - Finally has to flee
  - The government wants to impound his technology
    - ie, the general purpose AI / robots

- Discussion of the "repugnant consclusion" (check name? Parfitt?)

- Robots + utilitarianism = repugnant conclusion
  - Because resources are distributed by the government, not by individuals
