Outline
-------
Lawrence comes home to find his wife (Sally) in bed with another man.

The man turns out to be an older version of himself (Larry). He is not getting enough,
but does not want to be unfaithful to his wife. So he travels back in time to 
have sex with the younger version of Sally.

Young Sally is sympathetic.

The men fight.

Lawrence says he doesn't want Sally to do this. Sally persuades him that really he 
does. (As he will be Larry one day.) It's his choice. Lawrence agrees. Larry gives him
a wink and thumbs up.

They settle into a routine, with Larry turning up occasionally - "when he can get away" from
the older Sally. We learn more about time travel.

Scene where four turn up at once.

Lawrence is in the kitchen, making three cups of tea, when older Sally turns up.
She's a hot vamp / mature woman. Sees the three cups, thinks he's pathetic.

Calls up to Larry.

He comes down. "Two can play at that game."

She goes off with Sally.

The chaps go to the pub.

Scenes
------
- For each scene, say the key points of what we know at the start and where it has got 
  to at the end. What is the key new action / information / tension. 
  - ie, what is the *purpose* of the scene. Where is it heading / leading to?

- SCENE 1
  - Introduce Lawrence, including physical appearance.
    - Via thoughts about Sarita. (HR fantasy?)
  - Establish him as a physicist working on something time-related.
    - Antagonism with Wechsler.
  - Discuss his sex life. Pretty good - married 18 months.
    - Mention the "thing with the spatula and the oven glove"

- SCENE 2
  - Lawrence arrives home and discovers Larry in bed with his wife.
  - Thinks he is Wechsler at first.
  - Larry punches Lawrence.
    - Sally: "Stop it, Larry! Lawrence!"
    - Lawrence looks at him again: realizes it is himself.
  - Lawrence elated (despite Larry having sex with his wife) that time travel is true.
  - Larry says that the time-potential means he cannot stay long in the past, and goes back (to the future).

- SCENE 3
  - Purpose: Sally persuades Lawrence that he should allow Larry to keep coming back
    and having sex with her. It's in his own interests!
  - Sally says they need to talk (just after Larry has gone). Lawrence can't take it in, and
    goes to sleep in the lab.
  - Next day, pores over the equations. They must be right! But he can't see it.
  - Comes back home in a foul mood.
  - Argues with Sally - but she persuades him.
    - She says that her future self must be a cow. Feels regretful about this. 
    - Wants to make it up to Larry - who is Lawrence. 
    - "So you're saying that you are having sex with another man *because* you love me?"
    - He agrees that Larry can come back.

- SCENE 4
  - Lawrence changes his mind.
  - They have arranged for Larry to come back and for Lawrence to be out of the house.
  - But he comes back and intercepts Larry.
    - They - plus Sally - talk in the kitchen.
  - Larry talks about his future wife.
    - She complains he's always in the pub.
    - Lawrence: Not really one for pubs.
  - Lawrence finds out about Wechsler.
  - Discussion about money etc
  - Scene ends with Lawrence demoralized and agreeing.
    - Larry: "I'd love to discuss this more, but time's running out!"
    - He'll keep out of the house and wait for a phone call to tell him he can come back.
    - Larry: You could wait in the pub. The Red Lion's pretty good. I know I spent a lot of time there when I was younger.

- OR: Combined scenes 3 & 4
  - Lawrence is at work, but he can't find how to make the equations work.
  - He is *very* rude to Wechsler. (Which may goad Wechsler into looking at the equations?)
  - Comes back home in a bad temper again.
  - Finds Sally and Larry in the kitchen. 
    - They need to talk.
  - Lawrence finds out about Wechsler.
  - Discussion about money.
  - Larry & Sally persuade Lawrence that its all for the best.
  - Lawrence forced - by logic - to agree to it.
    - But we see that he doesn't really feel it.
  - Ends with Larry saying, "So you can just pop down to the pub, and I'll text you when we're done."


- SCENE 5
  - Scene where four Larrys turn up.
  - A few weeks later. Lawrence is in the pub.
  - Barman: "Your usual, sir? Nice to get away from the wife for a bit."
  - Lawrence thinking: Things were fine (tells himself)
    - Going great with Sally. 
    - If only Larry was out of the picture.
  - Sally calls because 4 Larrys outside.
    - Got to get them inside before anyone notices!
    - Fate, dice etc.
  - Lawrence can't go back to the pub - too humiliating.
    - Stays in the living rom, and tries to block out the sounds (with loud TV). Not 100% successfully.

- SCENE 6
  - Decides to kill Larry
  - Back in the pub, drinking too much.
  - This can't go on! Plans to kill Larry.
  - Goes back home. Gets a knife from the kitchen. Wipes fingerprints from it.
    - Wouldn't want Sally's to be on it.
  - Future Sally appears.
  - All in kicthen: two Sallys, Lawrence and Larry.
  - Show down.
    - Older Sally persuades younger Sally that she's not so bad.
    - That Larry / Lawrence are useless.
    - Better watch him with that slag Sarita Kapoor from the office.
      - He's got a thing for her.

    - Misunderstanding from Lawrence.
  - Women go off.
  - Lawrence has change of heart - fellow feeling with Larry.
  - Men go to the pub.








Condensed story
---------------
- Scenes spelt out more. All main points of action included.




Ideas
-----
- Mug:
  - Represents sex with Sally.
  - Its Lawrence's favourite mug. And Larry's too.
  - Larry doesn't get to use it as much in the future.
    - Sally doesn't like it.


- Rude to Wechsler
  - Wechsler suggests a "change of direction"
  - Not veryone is cut out for theortical physics
  - Maybe Lawrence can try experimental physics, or concentrate on teaching

- What does Lawrence say to Wechsler?
  - Along the lines of:
  - You better start being more polite to me, Wechsler. I'll soon be the boss around here.
    - Well not here, in this dump! 
    - You'll be begging to be my junior researcher.

- At work the days after discovering Larry
  - Could Lawrence be rude / surly / taunting with Wechsler?
  - Wechsler comes in to suggest a new line of (boring) research to Lawrence.
  - Career damagingly rude?
  - Then it's "Oh Christ!" when he finds out that he isn't going to be famous.
    - And Wechsler is.

- Tolchester
  - A new university - well, it had been new in the nineteen fifties.  
  - Established, as far as Lawrence could see, close enough to Oxford to 
    underline just to what extent it was not Oxford.
  - Now it was crumbling and generally shagged out, both in its physical structure 
    and the ideas and morale of the staff.

- Rainbow on way home
  - Damn Newton! World famous and Prof at 27??? 
  - Think I did that before, though!

- Larry: "So it's OK for me to keep seeing Sally?"
  - Lawrence: "Yes, but I'm not 100% happy about it."
  - Larry: "Don't work old chap. You will be."  
    - Thumbs up, wink.

- Lawrence
  - Proud of his abs
  - Does crunches and sit ups
  - Sally unimpressed
  - He knows its the only way not to go to seed later in life

- Wechsler
  - Hired during a fit of enthusiasm to seed a world-class physics department at
    Tolchester.
  - Based on some very promising sounding work in the mid 2010s
  - Made Prof at age of 38.
  - Now, six years later all he can contribute is to block the progress of other, brighter minds.

- Works at Tolchester University
  - Close enough to Oford to bring home just to what extent it was not Oxford

- *Things* ( external things) seem bad to Lawrence as he walks home
  - In a bad mood
  - So projecting onto external things.
  - (also: reason for some description)
    - Cotswolds??? But prettiness described as glib, cliched, "what an American thinks 
      England looks like)
  - Full of insufferable rich people with jobs in the media and god-knew what else
  - They only live there because of a legacy from Sally's great uncle

- Byrdden Spinney
  - The best that could be said about it was that it was staggeringly beautiful
  - Full of insufferable, self-satisfied, London outcast, media types (and god-knew...)
    with their Agas and their wicker log baskets and their season tickets to London.

- Story problem:
  - We have a "problem" set up early, ie that Larry is having sex with Lawrence's wife.
  - This is the problem that we want to see solved.
  - BUT: It doesn't get solved. At least in current version of the story.
  - Maybe Lawrence in the pub can be thinking about this.
    - He wants to stop it. 
    - Or does he?
    - Things going great with Sally (except that she is f**king Larry).
      - Could we repeat this. X is fine (except...), Y is great (except...), Z is wonderful (except...)
  - Maybe: Lawrence thinks that he's got to put a stop to it.
    - Comes up with a plan.
      - What would this be?
      - Could be to kill his older self. Or at least threaten him.
      - Grown to hate the older Larry.
        - Putting his selfish desires before his younger self.
        - Doesn't care that the Larry feels the same. Doesn't identify with him.
      - Body would go back to the future. 
      - It would only be his own fingerprints / dna on the knife. The perfect crime!
      - Suicide, but of himself in 25 years time.
      - Thinks this in the pub. He's been drinking.
      - "Are you sure you want another, sir?"
      - Not suiicide - killing that bastard who was shagging his wife.
        - Still - not ure he was thinking clearly.
        - But feels that he is thinking more clearly than he has before.
        - In a fight, he could kill Larry, but Larry could not kill him.

  

- Lawrence starts to spend more time at work or in the pub.
  - Thinks this while in the pub?
  - Things were going great with Sally. It was true that he was spending more time 
    at work or in the pub these days. But who could blame him, with what was going on?





- Larry on Wechsler:
  - That was twenty years ago. It's no use being bitter. 
  - Looking down and seemingly talking to himself... You just have to let it go. 
  - ie, he's not over it at all.

- Lawrence: Time travel - Larry could make money. Could tell him things to make money.
  - Maybe when he realises he won't be famous / successful.
  - Larry not interested in money.
    - Could win on horses, invent technology etc
    - Says these are not the important things in life.
    - Lawrence: "So we’re back to shagging my wife again."


- He took in the scene: the middle-aged man sittiing on *his* bed with his courderoy trousers
  round his ankles. His wife a small distance apart, in her underwear and wearing hold-up 
  stockings (she never wore them for him!). Guilty looks on their faces.
  - Maybe describe the room as well - "quotidien", ordinary, his normal stuff there.
    - Except for the addition of the middle-aged man with trousers etc...
  - He's elated that his research is vindicated.
  - Lawrence could not control his emotions:
    - "So it's true! My research. Time travel is actually possible!"
    - ie, more bathos

- When describing the room:
  - Notices his book on the bedside table. Larry has been reading it. Reading *his* book!

- Larry gets up - somewhat unsteadily, with his trousers round his ankles - almost overbalances
  but manages to land a punch.

- The time machine is a chunky wrist-watch device.
  - Larry calls it ("excuse the pun" - though clearly proud of it) a "time-piece".
  - Explains there is limited time.
  - Vanishes, leaving a slight scorch mark on the bedsheets and a lingering smell 
    of aniseed.

- What is the point of Wechsler?
  - He is built up quite a bit in the opening scene (maybe) as an antagonist
    to Lawrence. But does this go anywhere?
  - It sort-of does in the way that Wechsler invents the theory, and causes Larry 
    to be bitter / hedonistic.
    - "Best not to be too ambitious. It's not healthy to dwell too much on fame
       or success. I find that it's better to concentrate on enjoying the day to day 
       pleasures of life."
    - "You mean like shagging my wife?"
  - One possibility: Larry is Wechsler???
    - Really not sure about this, though.
    - Anyway - it doesn't add anything to the main love-triangle story.

- Could Sally angle for a threesome with Lawrence and Larry?
  - Lawrence could be against it, but then become keen.
  - But then he finds out about Wechsler, and can't bring himself to do anything.

- Maybe Lawrence (or the reader) is led to believe that it is Wechsler who is
  the older man at home when Lawrence comes home.
  - But then we find it is Larry.
  - Wechsler (described in first scene): 
    - Just like an American - trying too hard to be an English academic. 
      - "The Volvo-driving, tweed jacket-wearing, Guardian-reading ponce."
    - Then there is a Volvo parked outside the house.
    - Copy of the Guardian on the kitchen table.
    - Tweed jacket strewn on the floor in the bedroom.
  - Lawrence: "Wechsler, you ****. Get the hell away from my wife!"
  - Larry - turns round enraged. "Wechsler? Why the hell would you think I was that bastard?"
    - We see that it is not Wechsler: description like older Lawrence. 
    - We see the scar.
    - Takes a swing at Lawrence. Causes scar.
    


- University somewhere in the Midlands
  - Close enough to Oxford for it to be uncomfortably obvious that it was not Oxford.
  - If Lawrence could publish his paper, it might be his ticket out of that dump.

- Paper: "A new inequality in super-symmetrical time dilation effects"
  - A good title. 
  - Snappy enough to get noticed, but sober enough to be taken seriously.

- Maybe Larry tells Lawrence that Wechsler proved the inequality by applying
  Feynman diagrams to Lawrence's idea. 
  - "Brilliant, really brilliant. I know I would never have thought of it."
  - Wechsler is sole author of breakthrough paper, with a only note of thanks to his 
    "research assistant" Lawrence. Fumes! "And no-one remembers that note of thanks these days."
  
- Wechsler: Professor of Theortical Physics
  - In the unfortunate position for prof of theoretical physics in not having had an
    original idea in the last twenty years.
  - So has thrown himself into administration instead.
    - And ensuring that no-one in his department can achieve anything as well.
    - Can "eclipse him by producing any original research either" ??
    - Compensates for his own "academic impotence" by ensuring that no-one else
      can eclipse him by...
  - Would be a competent head of department, were it not that he also resists all
    new ideas from people in the department.
    - Lawrence fuming about this as he walks home.
    - Wechsler not allowing him to pursue his new formalisation of quantum 
      time dilation effects.
      - "quantum"??? or something else. Quantum is (mayeb) a bit boring.
      - "super symetrical time-dilation effects"
    - Wechsler said that the "math didn't add up".
      - That's because he was still stuck in the past, with his matrix mechanics and
        Feynman diagrams.
      - Or: "a one-trick pony with his over-reliance on Feynman diagrams and no ability 
            to see beyond them."
      - Didn't he realize that time, and maths, had moved on?
    - Wechsler is not allowing Lawrence to publish his paper
      - Because the "math does not add up"
        - Note: "math", as Wechsler is American.
      - The worst of it was that Wechsler was right: the "math" *didn't* add up.
      - Lawrence has tried to persuade Wechsler that this points to a new,
        exciting inequality in the laws of physics themselves. Though admittedly, one
        which he did not understand at the moment.
      - Wechsler had just said, "Come back to me, Oakley, when you have found you new 
        'inequality'. Or more likely found the mistake in your calculations."
  
- Could we start with:
  - "Dr. Lawrence Oakley came home early on Thursday evening, to find another man in 
     bed with his wife."
  - And then go back to his walk home?
  - On the one hand, this provides dramatic irony to his other (more trivial) thoughts.
  - It also (as well) means the reader is seeing the clues with the newlywed neighbours.
  - But: does it give the game away too early?
    - Easy enough to try.
  - Or:
    - "After a trying (infuriating?) day in the office, Dr. Lawrence Oakley came home early..."
    - Then can describe the day, and his thoughts.
   

- Could Larry accidentally give the ideas for time travel to Wechsler?
  - Wechsler is v. famous in the future - like Einstein
  - Larry gets him to autograph a first edition of his time travel paper???
  - Is this too cheesy?
    - Also: Not sure how /why Wechsler would sign a paper he had not yet written.

- "Two can play at that game"
  - Should Sally say that?
  - Or should we have Lawrence think it? Or infer it?
    - Maybe have him think it, while looking at her.
    - It's clear she understands him too well.
  - Or: She yells up at Larry, who comes down, pulling up his trousers.
    - "Working later at the lab, Larry?"
    - "Two can play at that game."
    - Lawrence looks hopeful.
    - The two Sallys go off together.

- How do we find out that Larry taught Sally the thing with the spatula and the oven glove?
  - It could be infered (rather than being told by Sally or Larry).
  - Or: We find out (indirectly) because Larry tells Lawrence that the future Sally
    won't do it any more.
    - Or: Sally explains this to Lawrence.

- Three cups of tea.
  - Lawrence makes them all a cup of tea for when Larry and Sally have finished.
  - One cup lots of milk, in first.
  - Two cups splash of milk, in second. 
  - Feels a warm sense of fellow-feeling with Larry as he makes this. 

- Goes past his own house, lost in thought, thinking it is the
  neighbours' house. They are newly weds. He can see them (silhoutte?) 
  at it.
  - Then he realized it is his own house.

- While thinking about the newlyweds, he muses about his own sex life.
  He's been married a short while (4 years?).
  Sex life not quite what it once was - but still pretty good. Still inventive.
  For example, that thing with the spatula and the oven glove that his wife has
  recently started doing. No idea where she got that from!

- Turns out that the older him has taught this to the wife.
  - The future wife has stopped doing it when Bake Off lost (unlikely star)
    when it moved to (online platform), and she just lost heart.

- Future wife has accused him of being unfaithful 
  - Or more, that he is going to be unfaithful.
  - She knows, because she remembers it happening.
  - Does he not find her attractive any more?
  - He says he does, but she knows that he will go back in time, so doesn't believe him.
    - And he knows it as well, of course.
    - (Should be a nice complicated bit of explanation.)
  - He hasn't gone back in time at this point, so he thinks it is unfair that she's
    cold to him because of this.
    - So he's driven to it by her rejecting him because he is going to do it.
    - "So you had to come back and have sex with my wife because, among other things, 
      your wife - who is the future version of my wife - wouldn't have sex with you 
      because she knew that at some point in the future you were going to, and in one 
      sense already had, come back and had sex with my wife?"
    - "Exactly. It's any excuse with that frigid bitch."
    - He looked at Sally. "No offence."
    - She squeezed his arm. "She sounds like a real cow."

  
- He does find future wife attractive.
  - But she's always got some reason for not having sex.
  - Pre-menstrual, post-menstrual, menstrual. Pretty much all bases covered there.
  - He's too fat. He slims down.
    - She's too fat (she thinks).
    - He says she's not. What does he know. She *feels* fat.
    - What does it matter what she thinks about how attractive she is? 
      - Is she having sex with herself???

- Two (or four?) of them turn up on one night.
  - Very awkward. 
  - They draw lots?
  - Maybe they remember (from young man's memory) that they heard the older version
    having great sex that evening. ("Soggy bottom!")
  - Young chap isn't going to stick around for that.
    - Goes to the pub.
    - But then for some reason does come back early, and does hear it.
    - Perhaps the older version texts him to say he's leaving.
      - But it was a ruse to get him to come back.
      - As he needs to hear, otherwise it won't happen.
  - It has to be the oldest of the ones that goes back that gets it.
    - Otherwise the later ones would not go back.
    - But in that case, (as they remember there being 4 of them)
      why do the earlier ones go back?
    - They could discuss this.
      - They decide that logically that has to be the case. But even so
        it seems unfair. So they draw lots, and the oldest one wins.
        (Which the older one had predicted - it can't be otherwise.)

- Young chap tries to stop this all happening.
  - (How??)
  - But he cannot - as it already has happened (ie, older versions *have* come back in the past)
  - So time travel to the past implies no (or limited) free will about the future.
    - If a single timeline (which this is - as the older versions remember what is going to happen)
    - They could discuss this.
    - e.g time travel *causes* the lack of free will?
      - Maybe you didn't have it anyway, and time travel just makes this clear.
      - "Best just to roll with it" says older version.
         - Like the dice. How can a dice not be random? Of course it is. 
           It's just that the outcome is "fated" to happen.
           So you have free will - it's just that you will freely chose a certain thing.
      - "You would say that (sophistry)," says younger version, "as you just want to fuck *my* wife!"
        - ie, bathos at end of a philosophical argument.

- Younger version vows not to work on the time travel theory / technology.
  - In the opening scene he is thinking about his bad day at work, and his 
    idiot co-worker.
  - It ould be that it was (will be?) the co-worker who disovers time-travel.
    - ie, nothing that the main character can do about it.

- Young chap is unhappy about it (especially when he first finds out)

- Young chap stands outside bedroom door (when he first comes home)
  - Thinks: Should he barge in, fight the other chap?
    - What if he loses the fight?
  - Tries to think what he would say:
    - "Get off my wife!" ?
    - "Stop fucking my wife!" ?
    - Sardonic approach: "Honey, I'm home". Too lame.
  - "My" wife - sounds like he own her. She's clearly chosen to do this. 
     Can he barge in with these patriarchial notions and physical violence?
     - Of course not! It made no logical sense.
     - But then he does anyway. "He kicked the door open..."
  - They spring apart. Man says: "It's not what you think..."
    - Wife says, "Really, hon. It's not what you think..."
  - Then he takes a look at the chap: older, physical description, shaved pubic hair? 
    Moves gaze upwards - somewhat flabby stomach - an old man! Looks at face.
    Reginning of double chin, scar on left temple. Receding hairline, greying hair.
    Looks familiar. News reader?


- They old and young version could get into a fight.
  - Maybe old chap hits young chap with something and cuts him.
  - Old chap has a scar (which he gave himself)
    - We'd see the description of the scar when we first see him.
    - ie, he gave it to himself

- We need a physical description of the young chap very early on.
  - So that we can mirror this description when we see the older chap.
  - Though slightly changed.
  - Need (from young POV) the description of the older man.
    - Description
    - Feeling that he knows him from somewhere.
    - Before realizing that it is himself.

- How do we physically describe the young chap early on?
  - Could he be thinking about a female co-worker who he is interested in?
    - Fairly sure she's interested in him, but not sure.
    - Thinks about his appearance at that point.
    - But he loves his wife, and has no desire to be unfaithful.
      - Well - not true that he has no desire, of course. But nonetheless will not do it.
  - If we have the female co-worker, then she should appear (be talked about) in the
    story later on.
    - Maybe wife accuses him of being interested in her.

- Co-worker
  - She's (fairly) new at work.
  - Young wife should have heard about her (???)
  - Co-worker is younger than him (she's 25 "fresh out of grad school"), he's early 30s.
    - So thinking about whether a younger woman like her might be interested in him.
    - Sure she was flirting with him.
    - Still... releationship at work is fraught with HR-related danger.
      - But how on earth are ambitious young people, who work long hours,supposed to
        meet people? Work is one of the traditional places for meeting your partner.
      - Damn the killjoy HR rules!
      - Then remembers that he is in fact already married. And happily as well.
      - Damn HR for even spoiling his sexual fantasies. 
        - Can't even have a sexual fantasy these days, without a fantasy HR person 
          intruding and spoiling the imaginary fun.
        - Though maybe it could work. Maybe an imaginary threesome with co-worker and 
          Claire from HR?
          - His mind leapt ahead to the fantasy tribunal. No, that would just go horribly wrong.

- Co-worker
  - Older chap reports that older wife accused him of having an affair with her.
    - Saw them flirting at the office Christmas party.
  - Younger chap: "And will I?" Sees his wife giving him a look. "I mean, did you?"
  - Older chap: "No."
  - Younger chap tries to outwardly look happy about this, for the benefit of his wife.

- The ending should make it look like the older chap is proposing that *they* have sex.
  - They watched the two women retreat hand in hand into the bedroom
    "Well - there only one thing for us to do," said X, slipping his arm 
    around his younger self's shoulders.
    "Let's go to the pub."

- Daniel Wechsler
  - Co-worker and rival of Lawrence.
  - American jew.
  - Lawrence works at (???) a prestigious UK university
    - But can't help feeling that Wechsler is only there because he is second-rate
      and couldn't make it at a more presigious American institution.

- It is Daniel, not Lawrence who invents time travel
  - Or at least the theoretical underpinning for it.
  - That bumbling fucker? He must have got lucky.

- Perhaps hint that Daniel has gone back in time and given himself the
  secret of time travel.
  - He's too talentless to have invented it himself.

- The Wechsler inequalities
  - Mentioned by Larry when Lawrence says that he will stop working on time travel
    - So that this whole mess will not happen.
  - Double-take: Wechsler came up with time travel? No way!

- Larry describes the theory of time travel a bit
  - Time travel to the future is possible
  - You just have to accelerate to close to the speed of light, decelerate and return home.
  - You arrive back in the future. Well known part of special relativity. (Twins paradox.)
  - This uses energy.
  - So it follows that time travel to the past releases a corresponding amount of energy.
  - This means that a vast amount of energy is released when you travel back in time.
  - But if you arrive back at the sametime you leave, the energy exists only as virtual
    particles which are reabsorbed into the quantum flux, avoiding the explosion which 
    would otherwise occur.
  - However, because of the uncertainty principle("when applied to the Wechsler inequalities"?)
    you can never arrive back at the exact moment you left, and the time delta depends on 
    how far back in time you travel and how long you stay there.
  - In this case, the time you can stay is 27 minutes.
  - "So I thought, what can I do back in time in twenty-odd minutes? And then it struck me."
   - Sally looks fondly at Larry: "Isn't that the most romantic thing?"
   - Lawrence looks at Larry, frowning. Pauses. "Did you say the *Wechsler* inequalities?"

- Does the 20 (23) minute thing really work?
  - I like it as a gag, but can we realistically fit in Larry's interactions
    with the present day into twenty minute chunks?
    - Is it worth doing this for the gag?
  - "Let's go to the pub. We've got time for a quick pint, if we hurry."

- Describe town, streets as Lawrence walks home from the station.

- Wechsler:
  - "He could only hope that if Wechsler were ever, however unlikely it seemed, 
    to come up with some breakthrough, he would be chosen to peer review it
    and could decisively reject it as the nonsense it was, or at least ought to be."

- Wechsler:
  - Overly familiar: calls Lawrence "Larry"
  - We get this before Larry calls Lawrence Larry when they first meet.
    - "I forgot. You've got this affectation at this age of insisting people call you Lawrence."





Questions
---------
- Is he a "scientist in a lab"?
  - Working on what will become time travel?
  - Or is he someone else (say the janitor?) who works at the lab, and uses the
    equipment for his own purposes?

- How can I make the ending work?
  - ie, the wives go off together.
  - Chap in the future was (will be) with his wife.
    - So how can the two wives have gone off together?
  - A1: Old chap comes back *because* his wife has run off with someone else.
    - BUT: Then the complaints about not getting any from the (future) wife don't
      really make sense.
      - Unless he is still living with the two wives.
      - Could be the case - but a bit weird, and doesn't really fit the ending.
  - A2: The wives go off together, but then she comes back to him.
    - Future chap could hint at this: "It's not like I don't know that she's not been perfect herself."
    - "She had a fling once herself."
    - To young chap: "Don't look so shocked. I know you're so pathetically in love with her, you'll take her back. I know I did."
    - BUT: Is this giving the ending away too much?
    - OR: This excange could come *after* the wives have gone off.
      - "I know I did. Now, let's  go down the pub."
      - NOTE: "Going down the pub" must be one of the complaints from the future wife.

- Where does Lawrence work?
