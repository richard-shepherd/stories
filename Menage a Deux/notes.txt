Outline
-------
Chap comes home to find his wife in bed with another man.

The man turns out to be an older version of himself. He is not getting enough,
but does not want to be unfaithful to his wife. So he travels back in time to 
have sex with the younger version of her.

Young wife is sympathetic.






Ideas
-----
- Goes past his own house, lost in thought, thinking it is the
  neighbours' house. They are newly weds. He can see them (silhoutte?) 
  at it.
  - Then he realized it is his own house.

- While thinking about the newlyweds, he muses about his own sex life.
  He's been married a short while (4 years?).
  Sex life not quite what it once was - but still pretty good. Still inventive.
  For example, that thing with the spatula and the oven glove that his wife has
  recently started doing. No idea where she got that from!

- Turns out that the older him has taught this to the wife.
  - The future wife has stopped doing it when Bake Off lost (unlikely star)
    when it moved to (online platform), and she just lost heart.

- Future wife has accused him of being unfaithful 
  - Or more, that he is going to be unfaithful.
  - She knows, because she remembers it happening.
  - Does he not find her attractive any more?
  - He says he does, but she knows that he will go back in time, so doesn't believe him.
    - And he knows it as well, of course.
    - (Should be a nice complicated bit of explanation.)
  - He hasn't gone back in time at this point, so he thinks it is unfair that she's
    cold to him because of this.
    - So he's driven to it by her rejecting him because he is going to do it.
    - "So you had to come back and have sex with my wife because, among other things, 
      your wife - who is the future version of my wife - wouldn't have sex with you 
      because she knew that at some point in the future you were going to, and in one 
      sense already had, come back and had sex with my wife?"
    - "Exactly. It's any excuse with that frigid bitch."
    - He looked at Sally. "No offence."
    - She squeezed his arm. "She sounds like a real cow."

  
- He does find future wife attractive.
  - But she's always got some reason for not having sex.
  - Pre-menstrual, post-menstrual, menstrual. Pretty much all bases covered there.
  - He's too fat. He slims down.
    - She's too fat (she thinks).
    - He says she's not. What does he know. She *feels* fat.
    - What does it matter what she thinks about how attractive she is? 
      - Is she having sex with herself???

- Two (or four?) of them turn up on one night.
  - Very awkward. 
  - They draw lots?
  - Maybe they remember (from young man's memory) that they heard the older version
    having great sex that evening. ("Soggy bottom!")
  - Young chap isn't going to stick around for that.
    - Goes to the pub.
    - But then for some reason does come back early, and does hear it.
    - Perhaps the older version texts him to say he's leaving.
      - But it was a ruse to get him to come back.
      - As he needs to hear, otherwise it won't happen.
  - It has to be the oldest of the ones that goes back that gets it.
    - Otherwise the later ones would not go back.
    - But in that case, (as they remember there being 4 of them)
      why do the earlier ones go back?
    - They could discuss this.
      - They decide that logically that has to be the case. But even so
        it seems unfair. So they draw lots, and the oldest one wins.
        (Which the older one had predicted - it can't be otherwise.)

- Young chap tries to stop this all happening.
  - (How??)
  - But he cannot - as it already has happened (ie, older versions *have* come back in the past)
  - So time travel to the past implies no (or limited) free will about the future.
    - If a single timeline (which this is - as the older versions remember what is going to happen)
    - They could discuss this.
    - e.g time travel *causes* the lack of free will?
      - Maybe you didn't have it anyway, and time travel just makes this clear.
      - "Best just to roll with it" says older version.
         - Like the dice. How can a dice not be random? Of course it is. 
           It's just that the outcome is "fated" to happen.
           So you have free will - it's just that you will freely chose a certain thing.
      - "You would say that (sophistry)," says younger version, "as you just want to fuck *my* wife!"
        - ie, bathos at end of a philosophical argument.

- Younger version vows not to work on the time travel theory / technology.
  - In the opening scene he is thinking about his bad day at work, and his 
    idiot co-worker.
  - It ould be that it was (will be?) the co-worker who disovers time-travel.
    - ie, nothing that the main character can do about it.

- Young chap is unhappy about it (especially when he first finds out)

- Young chap stands outside bedroom door (when he first comes home)
  - Thinks: Should he barge in, fight the other chap?
    - What if he loses the fight?
  - Tries to think what he would say:
    - "Get off my wife!" ?
    - "Stop fucking my wife!" ?
    - Sardonic approach: "Honey, I'm home". Too lame.
  - "My" wife - sounds like he own her. She's clearly chosen to do this. 
     Can he barge in with these patriarchial notions and physical violence?
     - Of course not! It made no logical sense.
     - But then he does anyway. "He kicked the door open..."
  - They spring apart. Man says: "It's not what you think..."
    - Wife says, "Really, hon. It's not what you think..."
  - Then he takes a look at the chap: older, physical description, shaved pubic hair? 
    Moves gaze upwards - somewhat flabby stomach - an old man! Looks at face.
    Reginning of double chin, scar on left temple. Receding hairline, greying hair.
    Looks familiar. News reader?


- They old and young version could get into a fight.
  - Maybe old chap hits young chap with something and cuts him.
  - Old chap has a scar (which he gave himself)
    - We'd see the description of the scar when we first see him.
    - ie, he gave it to himself

- We need a physical description of the young chap very early on.
  - So that we can mirror this description when we see the older chap.
  - Though slightly changed.
  - Need (from young POV) the description of the older man.
    - Description
    - Feeling that he knows him from somewhere.
    - Before realizing that it is himself.

- How do we physically describe the young chap early on?
  - Could he be thinking about a female co-worker who he is interested in?
    - Fairly sure she's interested in him, but not sure.
    - Thinks about his appearance at that point.
    - But he loves his wife, and has no desire to be unfaithful.
      - Well - not true that he has no desire, of course. But nonetheless will not do it.




Questions
---------
- Is he a "scientist in a lab"?
  - Working on what will become time travel?
  - Or is he someone else (say the janitor?) who works at the lab, and uses the
    equipment for his own purposes?

- How can I make the ending work?
  - ie, the wives go off together.
  - Chap in the future was (will be) with his wife.
    - So how can the two wives have gone off together?
  - A1: Old chap comes back *because* his wife has run off with someone else.
    - BUT: Then the complaints about not getting any from the (future) wife don't
      really make sense.
      - Unless he is still living with the two wives.
      - Could be the case - but a bit weird, and doesn't really fit the ending.
  - A2: The wives go off together, but then she comes back to him.
    - Future chap could hint at this: "It's not like I don't know that she's not been perfect herself."
    - "She had a fling once herself."
    - To young chap: "Don't look so shocked. I know you're so pathetically in love with her, you'll take her back. I know I did."
    - BUT: Is this giving the ending away too much?
    - OR: This excange could come *after* the wives have gone off.
      - "I know I did. Now, let's  go down the pub."
      - NOTE: "Going down the pub" must be one of the complaints from the future wife.
