Overview
--------
We are observing some (5?) nuclear physicists meeting and playing quantum Russian roulette.

They have each made a will in favour of the survivor. Because they each
survive in one branch, they will all inherit all the money.
(I guess they have no dependents who would suffer in the other branches.)

They have a quantum gun.

They kill themselves. Inlcuding the last one. "It's true - it works!" Then fires the gun repeatedly at his
own head: click... click.... click... splat.

One philosopher wins $1000 (invested in 1902): now worth $84094 (conservative investment). Adjusted for inflation isn't that great.
- Or $15571, if experiment is in 1974.

Other philosopher proposes "double or quits" (last line) for a simpler view
- It's not a coherent belief system that leads to "truth" in people's minds. It's simpler than that.
  - They'll just believe anything.
- Will people blow themselves up and murder other people, just because of something they read in a book?
- By the end of the millenium. Is that 2000 or 2001?
  - Double or quits.




Questions
---------
- Should they be physicists, or ordinary people who have read about quantum immortality?
  - A: Physicists

- Have the psychologists / philosophers been manipulating the history of quantum physics
  as an experiment? Or have they just fooled the people in the experiment?
  - It would be better (and more "plausible") if they had been manipulating the history.
  - Also: makes it more "likely" that they invented the Koran.
    - Done around the same time.

- What was the terms of the bet between the philosophers?
  - It doen't have to be made completely specific.
  - But I think it would be good if I know it!


Ideas
-----
- Have some discussion of epistemology at the beginning.
  - How do we come to believe things?
  - What distinguishes opinion and belief from the truth?
  - Coherence theory vs correspondence. But how do you know what counts as correspondence?
    - A: The scientific method. Experiment.

- The reader needs to suspect that it is a fake as the story progresses.
  - So maybe have some clues
  - Conversation between the observers.
    - Listening to conversations between the physicists,
      and observers discussing how they faked those experiments.

- The physicists should all have different looks and personailities
  - One gung ho
  - One scared
  - One greedy
  - One intellectual
