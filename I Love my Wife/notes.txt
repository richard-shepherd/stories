Plot (high level)
-----------------
- Man loves his wife, but isn't getting enough.
- She is turned on by "the fragility of life".
- He arranges various accidents (she does not know this)
- Wife gets rather jaded
- Done with comic effect, as these are increasingly hard to arrange
  and with increasingly terrible consequences.

Endings
-------
- a) He confides in a friend (the burden is too much)
     The friend seems sympathetic (though protagonist is woried he will go to the police)
     Friend kills him, and wife falls into his (friend's) arms
     (POV for this is "dying breath")

- b) Plans to kill sister, but kills wife instead.
     Sister falls into his arms
     He has to go through it all over again.

- c) We find out the wife was manipulating him all along

Which ending is *funniest*?
- I prefer a), I think. It is funny, and he gets his come-uppance.


Thoughts
--------
- Sometime it almost doesn't work
  - He only gets a handjob (?) after arranging some atrocity
  - Or poor quality blowjob. 
    - As my poor, bitten penis ejaculated the semen turned to ashes in my mouth.

- Maybe a blowjob scene where she thinks she's doing him a favour
  - But she's not very good at it

- Wonders about attracting / seducing his wife in other ways
  - e.g. getting fitter, being more romantic, taking up dancing, going away for weekend breaks, visiting art galleries
  - No: He can't face that. Better to just get on with the killing.

- Wonders whether he should visit prostitutes instead
  - No: That would be immoral.

- Planning an accident in a children's playground.
  - Thinks about his wife's reaction
  - Gets an erection

- Wants to get in touch with ISlamic terrorists
  - He is not sure how
  - Tries to put out "feelers" via his local corner shop
    - Shopkeeper, naturally, does not know any terrorists
    - Or maybe he claims he does not (horrified innocence), but he actually does?
  - (Got to try not be be too racist here. Either myself, or the character.)
  - Clive is trying to be serupticious, shopkeeper out loud, "Ahmed, do you know any of the IS guys?"
  - Clive could then decide to stage a terrorist incident himself and blame it on IS.
    - Maybe the shopkeeper gets rounded up, as he had been overheard talking about getting in touch with IS.

- Tragedies have to be close to home for it to work
  - He realizes this after causing (say) a coach crash on the M6
  - Very hard work, but wife just changes channel when it comes on TV.
    - "Let's watch something less depressing"

- So: initial success with a few smallish events (which are close to home)
  - Then bigger ones: still working
  - Biggest one yet (coach crash or whatever). Does not work.
  - Goes back to local, but still has to escalate

- What should the big failure be?
  - Needs to be big and bad and hard to arrange.
  - But should still be (somehow) funny.
    - Blowing up a synagague (with no one inside)?
      - His grandmother could be a Jewish refugee. "Sorry, Granny" under his breath.

- Want to try to avoid a Tom Sharpe tone.
  - Though this may be hard! It is rather Wilt-like.

- Police become suspicious
  - Maybe after he blows up the village church fate and tries to blame it on IS
  - They don't really buy this
    - Or maybe they do.
    - Senior policeman says it must be terrorists (he's done training course etc)
    - Junior is not so sure (more sensible)
    - Senior tells him to shut up: they get more funding if it is terrorists
      - Does Junior want that BMW patrol car or not?
    - Then they arrest the shopkeeper
      - Junior: But there aren't any muslims around here.
      - Senior: What about Mr. Patel from the shop?
      - Junior: What about him? He's lived here for years, plays in the cricket team.
      - Senior: Is he a muslim?
      - Junior: I don't know.
      - Senior: You  did that Cultural Sensitivity course. Is Patel a muslim name?
      - Junior: I think most Patels are Hindus, but some are Muslims.
      - Senior: That's good enough. Let's take him in.
      - Junior: But we've got no evidence.
      - Senior: You've still got a lot to learn, son. As long as we're filmed carrying his computer out in a plastic bag, that's all the "evidence" we need. Call the SWAT team!
    - Clive wonders whether he should tip Mr. Patel off.
  - Would need to work out the POV for this.
    - Either the police become a more major character. 
    - Or Clive overhears this

- Death or crippling>
  - Clive's calculation is all about how much this gets him.
  - Death: Once at the news. Again at the funeral - if it is a local person. Not so if the funeral is elsewhere.

- Juliet not responding properly on one occasion
  - Clive waits for the "live is so fragile" line which doesn't come
  - So he tries it: "Life is so fragile".
  - Could either work or not (depending on which is funnier in the circumstance).
  - Maybe it works one time, not on another.  

- Musing about marital predicament
  - Cannot have sex with wife
  - Against the rules to have an affair
  - Cannot have sex with prostitutes (and anyway he is frightened of this)
  - Masturbation is shameful (and you can't tell your wife about it?)

- Wonders about injuring himself
  - Maybe even tries this
  - Or just remembers a time he was injured.
  - Juliet had little sympathy
    - Or at least, practical sympathy but not in the way he wants
    - She viewed him as an invalid, as weak. Not in the right way at all.



What accidents / events does Clive organize?
--------------------------------------------
- Ideally, he would have some (at least minimal) justification for doing each one.
  - This can be quite tenuous, and may gets almost deliberately so as he looks for more victims
  - e.g. Sees a minor incident between a husband and wife: "Right - that gets you on the list."

- Cuts brakes on Juliet's sister's car
  - Perhaps the sister is rather annoying?
  - Or other accient with the sister.

- Plans accident in children's playground
  - Maybe does not do it though.

- Kills a nagging husband or wife.
  - Perhaps left crippled instead.
  
- Coach crash

- Changes crowd-sourced sat-nav, to divert traffic over an as-yet unfinished bridge
  - Bit of a long shot, but could have significant results

- Kills the vicar at the church fete (and blames it on "Muslims").

- Turns off Juliet's mother's life support.
  - Maybe causes a power outage for the hospital (think about what he does about the UPS / backup). 
  - He could just change the socket, from the red UPS one to the standard white one.
  - Mother is very ill. Juliet is concerned that her suffering is being drawn out,
  - So it is a "humanitarian act" (he tells himself).
    - Was there any moral principle to say that you should not kill two birds with one stone?

- Advise someone calling Samaritans to kill themself 
  - Not sure about this one!
  - Unless the person is just very annoying, and trying it on.
  - Overdramatic friend of wife. 

- Juliet witnesses a mugging. Mugger has a knife.
  - "She held onto her bag. I thought he was going to stab her."
