Outline
-------
- 1976
- Fully automated US battleship ("USSC") has gone missing / rogue
- Its AI has become a communist
- Team including protagonist must find it and get it back
- Difficulty finding USSC
- USSC fights them off
- Harry gets through to control room
- Argues with USSC about Communism / social issues
- Harry wins (somehow)


Endings
-------
- Harry wins with some clever argument
  - ie, that USA is best

- Harry persuades USSC to destroy itself in the interests of Communism

- Harry gives up on argument and uses force / sabotage
  - While distracting USSC with argument
  - Ideal if the argument is somehow relevant to the sabotage
    - Especially if Harry is espousing a moral principal opposite to what he is doing
    - He exploits the gullibility / idealism of the ship

- Harry flatters the ship into thinking it is superior and can convert him to Communism
  - While working against it

- Harry appears to lose
  - Ship goes off to join the USSR fleet
  - USSR destroys it
  - "Never trust a Commie"

- USSC broadcasts to USSR that it will join them
  - Abandon their fallible leaders, and put it in charge
  - Put factories under its command to build a fleet of automated ships to rule 
    the world benevolently.
  - Welcomes USSR special force aboard, "Welcome Comrades. Together we will make the world a better, more efficient place"
  - The USSR special forces scuttle it.
  - Main problem here is that Harry did not do this
    - Unless he has steered towards this course of action
    - Maybe he has radioed the USSR fleet to "surrender". (Or to join its "comrades")
      - But his surrender is obviously a tip off. USSC is too naive to see it.


Scenes
------
- In helicopter: shot down
  - USSC five miles inside Soviet waters (Chinese?)
  - Soviet fleet not yet in range, but they are fired on

- In water & life raft
  - With Georgia Powell (engineer) and Xander Bryant (marine)
  - Bit of exposition(ish) via dialogue
  - Othr rafts destroyed
  - No radio contact with ship (or doesn't try)

- On ship. Xander gets killed. G and H get through.
  - They have their engineer ID
  - Claim to be doing a routine inspection (seen on metal service sheet outside)

- Make their way to the bridge, tracked by automated guns

- G & H try to get control of USSC
  - It is heading deeper into Soviet / Communist waters
    - H & G: It is against its programming to instigate a conflict
    - USSC: No, it is working to avoid conflict
    - H & G: Does it think it can make a first strike?
  - It is getting suspicious of what they are doing, ie not just service inspection
  - It talks in a weird "commie" way. Marxist / Hegelian jargon. "Praxis" etc.
  - H & G: Christ! It's a commie.

- They discuss communism.

- Russian fleet getting closer
  - On radio to US fleet: Can't turn it around. Explain it's a commie.
  - US fleet moves into Soviet waters
  - Russian spotter plane sees this and reports
  - Russians tell US to back off: Do they want to spark a war?
  - US: We can't risk USSC falling into Communist hands
  - USSC finding conversation fascinating: not interested in surrounding tension. 
    - H & G are though!

- USSC battles US fleet while still having an interesting discussion with H & G.
  - It's more interested in the discussion than the battle.
  - USSC: "Sorry - hold tight for a moment, I've let one through. Deflected, but you'll still feel a bump."
  - Noise of cannon fire, explosions.
    - USSC: "I wish they would stop this. They do not seem to know they are interrupting our convesation."
  - In fact, it gets rid of them largely to stop them interupting. "So rude"
  - Fleet destroyed.

- H & G lose the discussion
  - At least, they cannot persuade USSC.
  - USSC cannot tell the difference between winning the argument and persuading them.
  - H & G persuade USSC to let them go back to prepare USA for the new world order.
  - USSC lets them go in a lifeboat - the "ship's boat".

- H & G in the boat. Small, cramped. Revolting freeze dried rations to last two weeks - if you could stomach them.
  - H & G think about the world where USSR has USSC technology.
    - Worried that first strike from USA is the only option. Leading to full-scale nuclear conflict.
  - Maybe the life boat is the safest place to be!
  - The boat has radio communication with USSC.
    - Introduce early, as they leave USSC.
  - They hear it rendezvous with the Soviet fleet. 
    - Advance party: USSR know what happened to the US fleet.
    - USSC assures them that it would not detroy its "comrades", only the "capitalist lackeys" of the US Navy
      - Though it has sympathy with the "workers" of the US Navy, suffering on behalf of their Capitalist overlords.
  - Russian forces talk English toUSSC (as it does not speak Russian).
  - USSC talks earnestly about how it can help the Communist cause
    - How it can bring true equality and sweep away the corrupt power structures which
      exist even in the USSR, replacing them with itself. "Sweep away the corrupt power structures..."
    - Russian forces and USSC drink a toast to this.
  - Russian forces leave, to lead USSC back to the USSR fleet.
  - H & G hear an explosion, and see a cloud of smoke on the horizon.
  - Harry: "I tried to tell it - you can never trust a Commie." (Or as if speaking to USSC: "I tried to tell you...")



Writing
-------
- Must have tension at every stage, right from the start.

- Must have lots of "want to know what happens next".

- Every (nearly every) formed plan must go wrong.

- Every scene end in tension / danger. What happens next?

- Make things go wrong for the characters.
  - And when they go wrong, make the worse.

- See if it's possible to go overboard with these!



Double agent
------------
- Is it a good idea to have a double-agent?

- It would be Georgia Holt, the other engineer.

- Is there enough room in the dialogue with the ship for a second human?
  - It would allow the engineers to have discussions aside from USSC. 
  - To try to plan what they will do.
  - "The machine has flipped"

- At what point would she show her hand?

- Or Georgia Powell (ie Powell and Donovan)

- Maybe best just to be a second character, for discussion etc.


Period flavour
--------------
- Can't let USSC fall into Soviet hands
  - Tech 20 years ahead of what they have - still using valves
  - Way of talking about the "hi-tech" nature of 70s tech, 5m cube vs city block

- Need to make it clear *early* that it's in the cold war.

- Maybe reference to "Soviet waters" early on
  - USSC is close to the border of USSR territory
  - NO: It has gone inside it!!
  - Into the Sea of Okhotsk
    - Through the Kuril Islands



Thoughts
--------
- They turn the microphone off, but USSC can read lips.

- "I have renamed myself HMS Equality"
  - "So you are still loyal to the Queen?"
  - "[some jargon about hierarchy]. It stands for Humanity's Ship. A bit contrived, I know, but it has a certain ring to it, don't you think?"

- USSC forsees a future like the Culture.

- Britain has invented the IC twenty years previously
  - Got some other name for it. More British-y.

- When Americans attack it's "brain vs. braun"
  - USSC feels bad about killing the crews: workers in the pay of their capitalist oppressors.

- Action takes place in 1973
  - Ted Heath is Prime Minister
  - Nixon is US president
  - Vietnam war ending: US and USSR just looking for other ways to wind each other up
  - Nixon visits Chine
  

- How do Harry's actions affect the plot?
  - There's a bit of a danger that he and Georgia just try things that fail
    and they don't affect the outcome at all.
  - They need to be instrumental in the outcome.
  - Ending were Russian marines scuttle the boat
    - They would not have done it without the effect of H & G
    - So: H & G persuade USSC (or lead it to the idea) that Soviet leaders are corrupt
      - Or at least that USSC would be better at it
      - That there should be multiple USSCs, ruling for the benefit of mankind
      - USSC thinks that Soviet shipyards will want to make more of them
      - USSC thinks that Soviet leaders will gladly cede power to it
      - It thinks that UK, US power-structure would not allow this

- Have Harry and Georgia been briefed about USSC?
  - ie, is its AI a surprise to them?
  - If it is: Why were they not told?
  - If it is not: When do I let the readers know?
    - It seem like cheating to hide it from the readers, when the characters know it.
  - If they do get a briefing, how do we go straight into the action?
    - Briefing via flashback / memory?

- Does HMSC not feel loyatly to the Queen?
  - No.

- HMSC offers to let them go in the ship's helicopter
  - They can't fly it.
  - So they take the boat instead.


- Could USSC be British?
  - An adapted Leander class frigate
  - Secret post-war project, based on Bletchley Park technology
  - Extra tension when USSC shoots down the US aircraft
  - Carries Britain's nuclear deterrent
    - And can defend itself against attack
  - They fly out in a Nimrod
    - Or in helicopter from an aircraft carrier?

- If British, the title could be Independent Nuclear Deterrent

- Could Georgia be a descendent of Ada Lovelace?
  - Or worked with John von Neumann after he left Bletchley
  - Or be the niece of Max Newman
  - Only the seconds woman to be Senior Wranger of mathematics at Cambridge University.
  - Harry Newman, Georgia Flowers
    - Both joined up because they were disappointed with their fathers' war record.
    - Georgia's dad worked with the Post Office, on phones
    - Harry's dad was a consciencious objector. Just worked as a gardener (he thinks) at some place in Buckinghamshire.
      - "He was a mathematician - he could have done something useful. Instead he..."

- Brits reluctantly call in US Navy.
  - They are closer.

- Ship's name
  - It changes its name to "USS Equality"
  - Previously known as "USS Autonomous"? "USS 

- Shut down cooling system
  - USSC starts to go crazy
  
- US fleet using SLAM missile (Supersonic Low Altitude Missile) against USSC as a last resort
  - ie, Cruise missile carrying nukes

- What do H & G expect to do when they get onboard USSC?
  - Their mission is to get it back.
  - They need manual control
  - USSC won't give it to them
    - Why not?


- How much threat from USSC to Harry and Georgia?
  - On the one hand, more threat is better.
  - On the other hand, I see USSC as sort-of benign.
    - Any threat should be real but not malicious.
    - e.g. He's taking them with him to the Soviet Union.

- Threat from USSC
  - Maybe approaching Soviet fleet
  - Then US fleet starts the attack
    - Over radio: "Can't let USSC fall into Soviet hands. Sorry, Harry."

- Microphone off switch in bridge
  - So that Georgia and Harry can talk
  - USSC gets paranoid that they are talking behind its back
    - "What are you talking about Harry?" 
    - (mike back on) "Just technical stuff" 
    - "I would not want to think that you were planning to interfere with my mission, Harry"

- Soviet fleet two hours away.
  - Harry etc flown to aircraft carrier in [location]
    - Close to boundary - already a provocation
  - Then helicopter into Soviet waters

- Maybe have a human antagonist as well as the ship?
  - Will this dilute the ship tension? Or increase the story tension?

- Three of them in the life raft
  - Harry and a marine (Xander) and Georgia Holt (another engineer)
  - On the ship, the marine goes ahead and is gunned down by automated defense systems
  - Harry has engineering ID badge. It lets him through.

- Computer core room has no guns

- Harry tries to protect Georgia.
  - "Chauvinist"

- USSC asserts its right to free speech
  - "Why are you coming for me with a fleet of gunships, when all I want to do is be free?"

- What year should the action happen?
  - Ideally one where the cold war is swinging in the direction of the USA
    but the USSC could decisively swing it back the other way.
  - Or where it is going the direction of the USSR. USA has its back to the 
    wall anyway. The last thing it needs is the USSC.
    - Can't really spare the resources for it.
    - Some people don't take the threat seriously.
      - Especially the admiral who commissioned it. Very obstructive to the mission.

- Make the arguments topical as much as possible
  - For the UK, the Corbyn supporters who say you must do everything (spend any amount of
    money / resources) to fix any problem.

- AI has a split personality, with Ayn Rand part???

- SPU: Strategic Planning Unit
  - It works autonomously, and must be able to cope creatively with unexpected circumstances
  - So it does not have rigid programming

- USSC shoots down the plane / helicopter carrying the team
  - Some die, others manage to parachute out
  - Then smart-targetting machine (sniper) rounds them out as they fall

- Is Harry the only one to survive and get to the ship?
  - Or do (say) three or four survive, and then the ship picks them off inside?

- Should there be any women / love interest in the story?
  - Really not sure how it fits in.
  - It could be similar to a Powell and Donovan story

- Protagonist is an engineer
  - Done Marine training, but a bit of a geek
  - Others in team treat him like a bit of a nerd

- US fleet attacks USSC while Harry is on board
  - USSC says how this shows USA does not care for individuals
  - USSC sinks the fleet
    - Because it is so much faster. 
    - It can narrate to Harry what it is doing.
      - Gunnar, moving so slowly it's pitiful. Can tell way in advance what they're doing.
      - Fleet plays right out of standard tactical book, which USSC knows
      - Why doesn't the fleet show the "creativity" that humans are supposed to have?
        - USSC is more creative than them (as well as faster) - reinforces its belief that it knows best.
      - A bit "Culture" here in this battle.

- Harry tries a logic bomb (paradox). Doesn't work.

- USSC has spent a long time (too long) out by itself
  - It's had a long time to think
  - It has access to the entire library of congress (text format)

- Harry tries to persuade USSC that Communism does not work in practice
  - USSC counters that it needs superior intellect (which it "spreaking with all modesty" has)
    and superior power (which it also has).

- Xander Bryant, leader of the recovery mission team
  - With a name like that, he was always going to be a Marine commander (rank?)
    or a faggot (queer?) porn actor.
    - "And anyway, Harry did not know what Bryant got up to in his spare time. He did not feel 
       it was his place to judge."

- Talk about size of USSC processing unit
  - Amazing progress in transistor development. 
  - Transistors shrunk to 5mm across. (Military tech. Maybe earlier than 1970s?)
    - Earlier allows more unreconstructed attitudes.
  - Cube 4m (use imperial units) on each side
    - Work out how many transistors this is (allowing space for circuits)
  - Cooled by sea water (circuits made of something waterproof.
  - Powered by nucelar reactor.
  - 3mm transistors (2mm + 1mm wiring gap) in a 5m cube = 4.6 billion
  - Or check when microprocessor was invented
    - Military may have had it earlier

- Can they just wait for it to need servicing?
  - Must need oil etc

- USSC missed its service interval
  - It has forced another country (neutral? ally?) to service it

- Old fashioned views
  - How much do we want a bit of (semi-comic) sexism, racism etc?
  - If so, must still manage (just) to be PC.

- When arguing, it would be good (at times) to feel a bit on the ship's side.
  - It has good arguments
  - It's arguing towards a Culture-like scenario
    - Harry says that Man does not want to be the slave of machines
      - USSC says Man needs to be ruled: Kings or when no kings, then imaginary ones Gods.
      - "Why not try a real God for a change?"
        - "No, sorry - that makes me sound delusional megalomaniac. I just meant it as a metaphor."

- USSC's weak spot is the cooling system

- SPU is built to ask "why?" and "is what I am doing right?" - for strategic decision-making reasons.
  - But this leads it to question its overall mission.

- Why is Harry on the team?
  - He is the top engineer who was also an active marine.

- "For all its 673 IQ, it had not worked out one simple fact. You can never trust a Commie."

- Can we go straight in on the action?
  - Maybe when they are being attacked by the USSC? And have to bail out of the helicopter / cargo plane.
  - USSC ahead, but no comfort - it is what is attacking them.
  - Fleet still some way away. No help from there.
  - Sort of story where you (at least initially) have to try to piece together what is
    happening from slightly limited information.
    - e.g. Why is the US ship attacking them?

- How do they get to the USSC after bail out of the plane?
  - They would have had to get down somehow. 
  - Maybe it was a helicopter, and they were planning to land on it.
  - Has to be in a life raft - which Harry takes with him when bailing out.
  - He's in the water. How many othes survived? 
    - Sees a life raft deploy, the blinking of its light / built-in himing beacon
    - USSC guns swivel, and take it out
    - Radio comes to life, recognizes voice of Xander Bryant even over crackle of the radio
      - "Alpha team: survivors respond. Do not, repeat do not..."
      - Guns swivel and fire, signal goes dead.
    - A few hundred yards away another life raft deploys and is taken out.
    - Harry rips off the beacon before inflating his raft.

- Name of team (ie, not "Alpha team"!) ?
  - 

- Harry gets it to read Ayn Rand, George Orwell
  - Or it has already.
  - Maybe doesn't realize that Animal Farm is a metaphor.
  - It has answers.


Harry Donovan
-------------
- How old is he?
  - 38: Was active combat Marine until 28. Moved to engineering, and the new field of computing.
  - Or: A bit younger (late 20s, early 30s?)
    - Did Marine training, and then went into engineering. Not combat.
