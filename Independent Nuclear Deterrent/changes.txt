- Make Harry an academic
  - If so, which subject?
  - A philosopher?
    - Philosophy of politics
    - And the emerging speculative fields of artifical intelligence
  - A Kremlinologist?
  - A zoologist - specializing in the cogniive abilities of animals

- "Need to know" at the briefing. 
  - They might not need him at all.

- Shot at
  - Then Harry thinking
  - Going to die in the middle of nowhere. He doesn't know where they are.
  - Speculates about where they might be. Captain had said Soviet waters. Could be the Kuril Islands, Okhotsk sea.

- More talky at the beginning?
  - Geogia is assigned to babysit the academic
  - Had made him wear a parachute? While eveyone around does not?
    - "If anything does happen (which it won't)" she would not have time to get him into it.

- Georgia grabs him and throws him out of the plane.

- Georgia pulls him out of the water.

- Was it the Russian attacking them?
  - No, it was HMS Buckingham.
  - They shot down the ship. They killed everyone! Destroyed te life rafts. Why would they do that?
  - That's what we're here to find out. Come on, Prof., we're going to the ship.
  - It was not like he had any choice.

- Could Harry maybe read the maintenance notice?
  - ie, he is the more cunning one. Georgia the more direct, practical type.
  - Georgia shot him an admiring glance. "Nice thinking, Prof."

- Does Georgia know that the ship is run by Epsilon?
  - Could go either way.
  - Maybe she's just there for other expertise - engineering. But not directly related to Epsilon.
  - She's heard some rumours though.

- How does Harry move from being a "passenger" to taking control?
