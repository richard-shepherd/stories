- 1: Sen. Jackson is giving a speech in Las Vegas NM
     - Mendoza is on duty
     - We get a feel for Jackson's fiery and determined character
     - Some discussion about LV and Plex Auto-motive
     
     - Key outputs:
       - Introduction to Mendoza: Rebus-like character
       - Feeling of Sen. Jackson's strong character
       - Feeling that Plex A-m is slightly sinister (or at least facelessly corporate)
       - Punchline: She's dead - we want to know more.

Phrases
-------
- The population of Las Vegas, New Mexico, had doubled to just over thirty thousand since the previous census, 
  ever since Plex Auto-motive had established their global HQ in the town. Detective Joshua Mendoza guessed that   around a quarter of them had turned out to hear Senator Gabrielle Jackson
  speak. There wasn't much else to do in the area, and Mendoza (guessed) that this counted as an exciting
  event to the local hicks. Who was he kidding with this cynical bullshit? He was LV born and raised himself, 
  and even though he was at the rally on duty, he was as interested as anyone in hearing what the Senator had to say.



Ideas
-----
- Introducting Mendoza
  - Imply his age by his years on the force
  - Imply his attitude by the fact that he is a detective, but stuck in a small town


- Plex A-m in LV
  - Population of LV had doubled from 15K to 30K
  - Not as many manufacturing jobs as promised
  - But plenty of the lower-life workers in both the formal and less informal service economies
    needed by the executives and geeks
  - Kept Mendoza in a job, so he guessed he couldn't complain


- Mendoza had voted for Sen. Jackson
  - That she was black shouldn't really have made any difference
  - Why were "minorities" all supposed to vote the same way anyway?
  - Mendoza doesn't feel any particular affinity with members of his own tribe
  - Why should he?
  - As far as he was concerned he was in a minority of one
  - That said, the fact that Sen. Jackson was black had made a difference
    - It made it somehow acceptable to vote Republican
    - Which he guessed he'd always wanted to do
    - Too political?


- Mendoza is on duty at the rally
  - Only police presence
    - He could call for backup if needed
    - Though it would take an hour to arrive from Santa Fe
    - He didn't expect to need it though
  - Sen. Jackson's rallies had attracted protesters in the past 
    but not any more since the anti-racist incident
  - They left her alone after that


- Sen. Jackson ends her speech with:
  - "I'm not going anywhere" or
  - "I'm not going away."
  - "The American love of freedom isn't going away. I'm not going away"
  - (Or something like that.)
  - "I am here with you. And while I'm here, our freedom is not going anywhere.
     I will never stop fighting for the freedom that is the birthright of all Americans."
  - Then: Two hours later she was found dead. According to the logs of the 
          Plex Auto-motive model X, she had killed herself."


- Menacing looking Plex A-m security guards looking on at Sen. Jackson's rally
  - They have some sort of Google Glass style thing going on


- Sen. Jackson: Not against Plex A-m or autonomous vehicles
  - Using one myself today
  - Kindly provided by Plex Am?
  - Or to show solidarity with the area's products?


- "Detective" Mendoza
  - Got the rank largely through time served
  - Not done much detection except (some small scale examples of local crime)
    - Youths who had watch too much TV trying to cook meth in a bathtub etc.


- Perhaps write Mendoza like Rebus
  - Wearily doing the right thing


- Mendoza on the Las Vegas PD
  - LV New Mexico: pop 13K


- Sen. Jackson famous for controntation with activists
  - She is a Republican, and was accused of being an Uncle Tom
  - Activists protesting a rally of hers
  - She does not apologize or hide away
  - Goes up to a young man - one of the (admittedly few) white protestors in the crowd
    - Carrying a "No Platform for Bigotry" placard
  - "You call yourself an anti-racist activist - and you're telling me, a black woman, what 
     I'm allowed to think and what I'm allowed to say?"
  - Maybe the week before her election to the Senate.
  - Went viral
  - Some people suspected that she had staged the event herself.
  - Mendoza himself had been impressed by this and had voted for her.
  - For the story: the point is that she is outspoken


- She is giving a speech in Las Vegas (NM)
  - My opponents ask me: Why don't we follow the example of the so-called 'enlightened' and 
     'progressive' European nations? [or some SF name for the future EU?]
     They have traded their freedom for a bit more security, a bit more safety, a bit more
     comfort. My answer is that they did not even consider it a trade. They lost the concept 
     of the value of freedom a long time ago. My answer is that we are not Europeans. We are Americans 
     and we do *not* give away our freedom at any price!"
     - Need a third "My answer is..." 
  - Mendoza is policing the event
    - Finds himself cheering along with the crowd.


- Maybe Plex Auto-motive comes under the LV jurisdiction?
  - Drawing on workers from Santa Fe and Albuquerque
  - But in fact in San Miguel County, and under the LV jurisdiction in particular
  - It's never been any problem for Mendoza
    - Apart from local people being priced out of the housing market. 
      - But overall more gains than losses, Mendoza thinks.
      - And the company played the game of Corporate Social Responsibility well enough
        to deflect the majority of criticism, especially with the bigwigs in Santa Fe Town Hall
        whose pet projects were well funded.
    - Maybe he's being unfair (he thinks)
      - Staff are well behaved, model citizens
      - Employment for the area (though less than might be imagined as PA-m uses so much automation).
        - If not employment, then at least taxes, to compensate.
        - It's the way the world was going, Mendoza reflects.


- So that's why Sen. Jackson is in LV
  - It's the home of PA-m
  - She's come to confront the special interests right on their doorstep
    - "We get to choose the rules. Not them!"
    - Perhaps this can be the third "My answer is..." thing?


- Need a Google-esque name for the company (in the "goes to Plex section"??)
  - Plex
  - Plex Auto-motive
    - Spin off from one of the largest tech companies of the early part of the century
    - With their typical hubris, they had decided that they could make the whole car factory
      and supply chain themselves better than the traditional car industry.
      - They have a foundry and factory
      - All almost entirely automated
        - Sold to customers as "100% American Made" - true, as long as no-one gave too much thought to 
          the fact that that no American worker - aside from a few geeks at their keyboards - was 
          involved anywhere in the manufacturing process.
          - Geeks at keyboards: increasingly few of these as AI started coming for their jobs as well.
            - Mendoza: Served them right
      - Hubris: but they were right
