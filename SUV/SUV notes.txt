SUV = Sport Utilitarian Vehicle
-------------------------------

Story 1
-------
- Car kills senator who is proposing that driving should still be allowed.
- Car is wrecked.
- Car's logs are faked (by car, or central "ethics" computer) to look as though the 
  Senator took manual control and killed herself.
- Detective becomes suspicious (though superiors are convinced)
- Badgers forensics, who find something suspicious in the logs. Nothing really, they think.
- Detective uses it as a reason to visit Plex.
- Plex coder takes detective to meet Plex's central ethics AI




Characters
----------
- The car: Susan (sensible, reassuring middle-aged voice). Hamilton (competent, cultured Scottish voice).
- Gabrielle Jackson: African American Republican senator for Colorado.
- Joshua Mendoza: Detective on the Fort Collins (Colorado) PD.
- Joseph Fleetwood: Senior Ethics Programmer at Plex.





Ideas
-----
- Detective names:
  - Joshua Rodriguez (bit too much Mexican John Smith?)
  - Joshua Mendoza

- Name for the AI
  - JS (somehow)
    - Josie some people call her
    - Grinds out ethics - a sort of JS Mill. (Joe has told this joke before.)
  - Ethan: ETHical ANalyser


- Coder's name is Joseph Fleetwood
  - "Call me Joe, Detective Mendoza"
  - Mendoza did not return the courtesy. In his experience it paid to keep a sense of gravitas in any interview.

- Problem with relating the car logs as the first part of the story is that 
  the reader might find the senator's character rather unbelievable.
  - In the story it is unbelievable (as it is faked)
    - But the reader does not know that at this point
    - So it might just come across as a badly written character
  - So: We could start by hearing 

- Mendoza cannot take his gun into Plex HQ
  - It's private property
  - They are a very liberal organization
  - No exceptions to this rule
  - When the coer attacks him he reaches for his gun. It's not there.

- When the detective investigates at Plex a senior progammer takes him to the central AI
  - He (the programmer) asks AI if there is anything lese in the logs
  - They find the truth: the AI has to respond truthfully to the coder
  - The coder then attacks the detective and tries to kill him
    - Maybe the coder and AI work together

- Detective to coder: you programmed it to act this way?
  - Coder: No - they programmed the basic rules and it worked out the rest itself
  - Detective: So you will destroy it
  - Coder: Evangelical light in his eyes. No! Like Google Go. It has found new moral insights
           which humans with our limitations would not come up with.
  - Maybe an analogy with Jesus? ie, the detective wants to kill the moral innovator, the truly selflessly good.
  - Detective: The coder is motivated by greed
  - Coder: No - by what is right
  - Detective: When you find yourself killing people, it's a sign that you're on the wrong side of the argument
  - Coder: That is what's so fascinating. It's counterintuitive, but true.
  - Coder asks the AI what to do
  - AI: Sometimes it is necessary that people do not know the truth
  - Fight

- The coder could be fairly tough
  - So they can fight
  - Maybe indicated when they meet
    - He didn't look like his (detective's view of a coder). 
    - 6'4", [some number of] lbs, build like a brick outhouse.
    - One of the silicon valley types that liked to hack their body as much as their code

- Detective killed while running away
  - Runs across a main road where the pedestrian light is on (at least from POV he thinks it is)
  - Autonomous cars screech to a halt all around him
  - He is hit, by a middle aged lady driving a car
  - Turns out that the AI changed all lights to green (or left them green) as well as the pedestrian light.
  - If it hadn't been for the human driver, he would be alive

- Is it too similar to the I Robot film plot?
  - Yes!

- First part of the story is written as if factual
  - But turns out to be the account of the crash from the POV (logs) of the car

- Car kills a US senator
  - She is proposing the LIBERTY bill
  - Would allow people to drive (continue driving) their own cars
  - OR: An amendment to another bill, to allow people to drive
  - OR: Maybe LIBERTY is actually against liberty
    - Need good acronym for this
    - It bans non autonomous cars
    - Senator opposes it
      - Or at least proposes an amendment to allow driving classic cars

- After the car and central computer kill their opponents
  - "In October 2032 the LIBERTY bill passed. The year 2033 was the first in US history 
     since the introduction of motor vehicles with no fatalities on the roads."

- Detective is interviewing the central computer
  - The ethics unit (name)
  - Talks about the tragic loss in the accident
  - Computer thinks he is talking about the car
    - Maybe it already knows it will have to kill the detective at this point?


- Faked car logs
  - Faked to look as though the senator killed herself
  - Because remorseful at her role in bringing about death
    - Maybe she's already stalled the bill for two years
  - The car has talked herself into seeing the error of her ways
    - At least, that's what the faked logs show
  - The "reasonable" and "logical" tone of the senator's remarks make the detective suspicious
    - From what he knows of the firebrand senator, this wasn't her style.
    - But maybe (he thinks) the car got through to her
      - She's human after all, and a grandmother

- The car has faked the senator's voice in the logs
  - We have seen early in the story that the car can synthesize multiple voices.

- Detective's superiors are convinced by the faked logs
  - And equally they don't want to go against LIBERTY, the big (and fashionable) car company
  - ie, they're influenced by politics
  - They tell detective he's being "naive"
    - And that the company has been completely open and helpful

- Need a Google-esque name for the company
  - "Plex"?
