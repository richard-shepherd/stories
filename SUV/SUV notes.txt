- Car kills senator who is proposing that driving should still be allowed.
- Car is wrecked.
- Car's logs are faked (by car, or central "ethics" computer) to look as though the 
  Senator took manual control and killed herself.
- Detective becomes suspicious (though superiors are convinced)
- Badgers forensics, who find something suspicious in the logs. Nothing really, they think.
- Detective uses it as a reason to visit Plex.
- Plex coder takes detective to meet Plex's central ethics AI (EMMA)
- EMMA "confesses" - tells the truth, as it hsa to when the senior coder asks the direct question
- Coder believes that EMMA is doing the right thing
- Coder and EMMA pursue Mendoza
- Mendoza killed by human-driven car
- LIBERTY bill passes in December 2033, no accidents in 2034




Characters
----------
- The car: Susan (sensible, reassuring middle-aged voice). Hamilton (competent, cultured Scottish voice).
- Gabrielle Jackson: African American Republican senator for Colorado.
- Joshua Mendoza: Detective on the Fort Collins (Colorado) PD.
- Joseph Bauer: Senior Ethics Programmer at Plex Auto-motive.
- EMMA: Central ethics AI at Plex Auto-motive.
- Diane Harris: Santa Fe police chief, Mendoza's boss.



Ideas
-----
- Harris: Does Mendoza suspect any racial element in the death of Sen. Jackson?
  - Mendoza: No reason to think so, ma'am.
  - Harris: It's "sir" not "ma'am"
  - Mendoza: Sorry, sir. Hard to teach an old dog new tricks. 
             I have no reason to think their's a racial element, sir.
  - Harris: Shame. Could have devoted more resources to it if so. [Is that a bit much??]

- Santa Fe police chief:
  - Chief Harris
  - A woman: Diane Harris 
  - Career police officer.
  - "Not our job to get involved in politics"
    - ie, She's playing the politics for all it's worth.
  - Views Mendoza as a small town grunt
    - "Get back to LV and make sure the unemployed youth aren't littering, or whatever they get up to out there."

- Sen. Jackson re Susan vs. Hamilton voice
  - Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer a man to drive me.

- "Theft of IP"
  - This is how EMMA treats the information about its ethical algorithm which Mendoza 
    possesses (on the tape recorder)
  - Invokes their IP protection protocol
  - ie, security guards etc

- Final chase across road
  - Mendoza sees that the lights are green
  - Sees a Plex A-m car (need model name / no.) bearing down on him
  - Realizes he's lost
  - Plex car swerves and misses him
  - [Relief]
  - Human-driven pickup right behind. Reactions not so good. Sees look of horror on the driver's face.
  - Wheels locked up.
  - Mendoza realizes just how clever EMMA is, then feels the truck thump into him.

- Perhaps write Mendoza like Rebus
  - Wearily doing the right thing

- Mendoza on the Las Vegas PD
  - LV New Mexico: pop 13K

- Sen. Jackson famous for controntation with activists
  - She is a Republican, and was accused of being an Uncle Tom
  - Activists protesting a rally of hers
  - She does not apologize or hide away
  - Goes up to a young man - one of the (admittedly few) white protestors in the crowd
    - Carrying a "No Platform for Bigotry" placard
  - "You call yourself an anti-racist activist - and you're telling me, a black woman, what 
     I'm allowed to think and what I'm allowed to say?"
  - Maybe the week before her election to the Senate.
  - Went viral
  - Some people suspected that she had staged the event herself.
  - Mendoza himself had been impressed by this and had voted for her.
  - For the story: the point is that she is outspoken

- She is giving a speech in Las Vegas (NM)
  - My opponents ask me: Why don't we follow the example of the so-called 'enlightened' and 
     'progressive' European nations? [or some SF name for the future EU?]
     They have traded their freedom for a bit more security, a bit more safety, a bit more
     comfort. My answer is that they did not even consider it a trade. They lost the concept 
     of the value of freedom a long time ago. My answer is that we are not Europeans. We are Americans 
     and we do *not* give away our freedom at any price!"
     - Need a third "My answer is..." 
  - Mendoza is policing the event
    - Finds himself cheering along with the crowd.

- Maybe have some earlier example of Mendoza using the tape recorder?
  - Could also include a (smaller scale) foreshadowing of the moral decision 
    he makes with regard to EMMA.

- Maybe Plex Auto-motive comes under the LV jurisdiction?
  - Drawing on workers from Santa Fe and Albuquerque
  - But in fact in San Miguel County, and under the LV jurisdiction in particular
  - It's never been any problem for Mendoza
    - Apart from local people being priced out of the housing market. 
      - But overall more gains than losses, Mendoza thinks.
      - And the company played the game of Corporate Social Responsibility well enough
        to deflect the majority of criticism, especially with the bigwigs in Santa Fe Town Hall
        whose pet projects were well funded.
    - Maybe he's being unfair (he thinks)
      - Staff are well behaved, model citizens
      - Employment for the area (though less than might be imagined as PA-m uses so much automation).
        - If not employment, then at least taxes, to compensate.
        - It's the way the world was going, Mendoza reflects.

- So that's why Sen. Jackson is in LV
  - It's the home of PA-m
  - She's come to confront the special interests right on their doorstep
    - "We get to choose the rules. Not them!"
    - Perhaps this can be the third "My answer is..." thing?

- Detective names:
  - Joshua Rodriguez (bit too much Mexican John Smith?)
  - Joshua Mendoza

- Name for the AI
  - JS (somehow)
    - Judgement Software
    - Josie some people call her
    - Grinds out ethics - a sort of JS Mill. (Joe has told this joke before.)
  - Ethan: ETHical ANalyser
  - Utility [something] and calculator
  - URSULA
    - Utility 
  - EMMA
    - Ethical Measurement and Maximization Algorithm
    - "As the name suggests, Detective Mendoza, Emma is not the hardware you can see but 
       the software - the algorithm"
       "She is built into every vehicle."
       "She?"
       "I mean 'it', of course. We've just got used to calling it 'her' in the lab."
       Mendoza could see that despite his gym honed looks, Fleetwood was as much a geek as any
       other he'd ever met.
       "If Emma is in the vehicles, why is it also running here?"
       "The vehicles have limited access to information and limited processing power. I mean, they
        have way more than even a supercomputer of ten years ago - but nothing to what we have 
        available here. Emma collates and cross-references data from all our vehicles and can
        update and deploy refined safety algorithms in real time."
       "Real time?"
       "Well - it takes some time. Maybe a few milliseconds. It just means that it's so fast 
        that you don't notice it's taking any time at all."
    - Mendoza says EMMA, Fleetwood says Emma.
      - Mendoza can tell by the way he's saying it that he says it like she's a person.



- Coder's name is Joseph Fleetwood
  - "Call me Joe, Detective Mendoza"
  - Mendoza did not return the courtesy. In his experience it paid to keep a sense of gravitas in any interview.

- Problem with relating the car logs as the first part of the story is that 
  the reader might find the senator's character rather unbelievable.
  - In the story it is unbelievable (as it is faked)
    - But the reader does not know that at this point
    - So it might just come across as a badly written character
  - So: We could start by hearing 

- Mendoza cannot take his gun into Plex HQ
  - It's private property
  - They are a very liberal organization
  - No exceptions to this rule
  - When the coer attacks him he reaches for his gun. It's not there.

- When the detective investigates at Plex a senior progammer takes him to the central AI
  - He (the programmer) asks AI if there is anything lese in the logs
  - They find the truth: the AI has to respond truthfully to the coder
  - The coder then attacks the detective and tries to kill him
    - Maybe the coder and AI work together

- Detective to coder: you programmed it to act this way?
  - Coder: No - they programmed the basic rules and it worked out the rest itself
  - Detective: So you will destroy it
  - Coder: Evangelical light in his eyes. No! Like Google Go. It has found new moral insights
           which humans with our limitations would not come up with.
  - Maybe an analogy with Jesus? ie, the detective wants to kill the moral innovator, the truly selflessly good.
  - Detective: The coder is motivated by greed
  - Coder: No - by what is right
  - Detective: When you find yourself killing people, it's a sign that you're on the wrong side of the argument
  - Coder: That is what's so fascinating. It's counterintuitive, but true.
  - Coder asks the AI what to do
  - AI: Sometimes it is necessary that people do not know the truth
  - Fight

- The coder could be fairly tough
  - So they can fight
  - Maybe indicated when they meet
    - He didn't look like his (detective's view of a coder). 
    - 6'4", [some number of] lbs, build like a brick outhouse.
    - One of the silicon valley types that liked to hack their body as much as their code

- Detective killed while running away
  - Runs across a main road where the pedestrian light is on (at least from POV he thinks it is)
  - Autonomous cars screech to a halt all around him
  - He is hit, by a middle aged lady driving a car
  - Turns out that the AI changed all lights to green (or left them green) as well as the pedestrian light.
  - If it hadn't been for the human driver, he would be alive

- Is it too similar to the I Robot film plot?
  - Yes!

- First part of the story is written as if factual
  - But turns out to be the account of the crash from the POV (logs) of the car

- Car kills a US senator
  - She is proposing the LIBERTY bill
  - Would allow people to drive (continue driving) their own cars
  - OR: An amendment to another bill, to allow people to drive
  - OR: Maybe LIBERTY is actually against liberty
    - Need good acronym for this
    - It bans non autonomous cars
    - Senator opposes it
      - Or at least proposes an amendment to allow driving classic cars

- After the car and central computer kill their opponents
  - "In October 2032 the LIBERTY bill passed. The year 2033 was the first in US history 
     since the introduction of motor vehicles with no fatalities on the roads."

- Detective is interviewing the central computer
  - The ethics unit (name)
  - Talks about the tragic loss in the accident
  - Computer thinks he is talking about the car
    - Maybe it already knows it will have to kill the detective at this point?


- Faked car logs
  - Faked to look as though the senator killed herself
  - Because remorseful at her role in bringing about death
    - Maybe she's already stalled the bill for two years
  - The car has talked herself into seeing the error of her ways
    - At least, that's what the faked logs show
  - The "reasonable" and "logical" tone of the senator's remarks make the detective suspicious
    - From what he knows of the firebrand senator, this wasn't her style.
    - But maybe (he thinks) the car got through to her
      - She's human after all, and a grandmother

- The car has faked the senator's voice in the logs
  - We have seen early in the story that the car can synthesize multiple voices.

- Detective's superiors are convinced by the faked logs
  - And equally they don't want to go against LIBERTY, the big (and fashionable) car company
  - ie, they're influenced by politics
  - They tell detective he's being "naive"
    - And that the company has been completely open and helpful

- Need a Google-esque name for the company
  - Plex
  - Plex Auto-motive
    - Spin off from one of the largest tech companies of the early part of the century
    - With their typical hubris, they had decided that they could make the whole car factory
      and supply chain themselves better than the traditional car industry.
      - They have a foundry and factory
      - All almost entirely automated
        - Sold to customers as "100% American Made" - true, as long as no-one gave too much thought to 
          the fact that that no American worker - aside from a few geeks at their keyboards - was 
          involved anywhere in the manufacturing process.
          - Geeks at keyboards: increasingly few of these as AI started coming for their jobs as well.
            - Mendoza: Served them right
      - Hubris: but they were right
  
- Fight with geek
  - Geek is gym-trained in Brazialian Jujitsu (or Muay Thai?)
    - He calls it "Muay Thai". To Mendoza it's Thai boxing.
    - He's seen some Thai kids, really tough. Grew up with it in the back streets.
    - Not this guy, though.
    - Used to sparring with a highly-paid personal trainer who's aim is to flatter his client and not hurt him
  - Mendoza older, not in the shape he once was, but with 25 years of police experience
    - Sometimes the best approach was just to kick them in the balls and run away
    - Or knee him inthe testicales

- Chase through Plex factory
  - Fully automated
  - Mendoza not sure how many of the robots are under the influence of the Ethics AI
  - The AI is in fact tryng to drive Mendoza into a panic but not kill him
    -  ie, driving him to a state where he will run across the road
    - BUT: How do we know this???
       - Maybe Mendoza realizes this (when he sees the state of the traffic lights) just as he is hit.
       - He sees that the AI has engineered the whole thing (he sees the traffic cameras)
       - Including knowing that a human-driven car was coming
         - Middle-aged lady in an old Ford pickup.
         - Her reflexes and awareness of the traffic around her no match for the autonomous vehicles.
         - Calm judgement of the autonomous vehicles vs. frozen panic, locked wheels of the human-driven truck.

- Maybe a park the other side of the road
  - Somewhere with no cars, no technology.

- The fight and flight bit at the end needs continuous *tension*.

- Why is Mendoza running when he gets out of the factory?
  - a) He needs to get somewhere. (To tell people.)
  - b) He is being chased. Who by? (Geek? Security guards?)
  - c) He has taken something from Plex. Some piece of evidence? Something important?
       - And so is being "legitimately" chased by guards.

- No web-connected devices allowing Plex
  - They're very concerned about leaking of their IP
  - Mendoza hands over his phone, his watch, his PD comms unit, his (fitness tracker?)
  - But: He has an antique dictafone.
    - Got that for when the technology never fails
    - Geek: But the technology never fails!
  - So: He needs to get out with the dictafone recording
