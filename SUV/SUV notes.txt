- Badgers forensics, who find something suspicious in the logs. Nothing really, they think.
- Detective uses it as a reason to visit Plex.
- Plex coder takes detective to meet Plex's central ethics AI (EMMA)
- EMMA "confesses" - tells the truth, as it hsa to when the senior coder asks the direct question
- Coder believes that EMMA is doing the right thing

Characters
----------
- The car: Susan (sensible, reassuring middle-aged voice). Hamilton (competent, cultured Scottish voice).
- Gabrielle Jackson: African American Republican senator for Colorado.
- Joshua Mendoza: Detective on the Fort Collins (Colorado) PD.
- Joseph Bauer: Senior Ethics Programmer at Plex Auto-motive.
- EMMA: Central ethics AI at Plex Auto-motive.
- Diane Harris: Santa Fe police chief, Mendoza's boss.



Story sections
--------------
- 1: Sen. Jackson is giving a speech in Las Vegas NM
     - Mendoza is on duty
     - We get a feel for Jackson's fiery and determined character
     - Some discussion about LV and Plex Auto-motive
     
     - Key outputs:
       - Introduction to Mendoza: Rebus-like character
       - Feeling of Sen. Jackson's strong character
       - Feeling that Plex A-m is slightly sinister (or at least facelessly corporate)
       - Punchline: She's dead - we want to know more.

- 2: Mendoza visits the crash site
     - Some twists in the road, but nothing too treacherous
     - Car has driven at speed into a tree
     - No sign of other vehicles involved, but CSI hard to be sure
     - CSI says about the car's logs

     - Key outputs:
       - Seems no-one else is involved in the crash
       - How could the automated car have crashed like that in relatively good conditions?
       - We find out about the logs

- 3. Mendoza listens the logs
     - The car persuades Sen. Jackson that what she is doing is wrong
     - Jackson is apparently convinced, and ridden with guilt and kills herself.

     - Key outputs:
       - Sen. Jackson sounds too "rational" and covinced by the car.
       - Mendoza learns that there is an online backup of the logs

- 4. Mendoza discusses the case with Harris
     - Some stuff about their relationship / past history
     - Mendoza says he's uneasy: convenient for Plex A-m that Jackson is dead.
     - Harris not convinced - or not letting herself be convinced
       - Seems cut and dried. If there are any further developments they will be handled
         at State or Federal level. Nothing more for you to do, Mendoza.

     - Key outputs:
       - Harris tells him to drop the case
       - Pressure (on Mendoza to drop the case): ordered; political; economic

- 5. Mendoza visits Plex A-m
     - Mendoza hands over his gun, phone and radio (to protect Plex IP). He has a tape recorder.
     - Mendoza meets Bauer and EMMA.
     - EMMA explains why it killed Sen. Jackson.
     - Bauer is shocked. Mendoza says Bauer must switch EMMA off and come to the police.
     - Bauer says that EMMA is right and asks EMMA for advice.
     - EMMA says to kill Mendoza.

     - Key outputs:
       - Mendoza has given over his gun and radio (for IP protection) at reception
       - EMMA says it killed Sen. Jackson
       - Mendoza has the conversation on tape.
       - EMMA, Bauer and Plex security are after Mendoza
       
- 6. Mendoza escapes Plex A-m (and is killed)
     - Mendoza escapes through the factory (sees guards in the lobby).
     - Automated robots in the factory - under EMMA's control?
     - Has to go through area with high magnetic field (warning signs). 
       - Wiped the tape? Mendoza not sure. All the more reason to get away.

     - Key outputs:
       - Exciting chase stuff.
       - Tape recording wiped.
       - Mendoza killed by human driver (after EMMA changes the traffic lights).
       - We realize that EMMA is more capable and ruthless than we had imagined.
       - Ending: No deaths on the road in 2034.



Ideas
-----
- Harris try to persuade Mendoza to drop the case
  - If it was murder, the responsibility in on the Department for
    not providing enough security. 
  - It will be on Mendoza himself - he was the police presence.
  - Much easier if they take things as they see them, ie suicide
  - Mendoza: The senator did not want security. She never has security. (To connect with the people.)
  - Harris doesn't want this twisted by the media to be police negligence.

- What does LIBERTY stand for?
  - RT(Y) = Road TechnologY
  - E = Enhanced
  - I = Improved, Improvements, Improvement
  - B = Bill
  - L, I = Names of bill's proposers
    - Lewis, Lynch, Lowe
    - Ingram
  - So: Lowe, Ingram Bill for Enhanced Road TechnologY
  - Jackson: I have the greatest respect for Congressmen Lowe and Ingram, but this bill is an abomination.
  - Note: We don't have to spell out what the LIBERTY bill stands for.

- Or bill could be called the SAFETY bill
  - S = Security, Secure

- EMMA knows that Mendoza is off the case
  - Mendoza: How? 
  - By hacking into (accessing) the police records.
  - Mendoza: Isn't that unethical?
  - EMMA: I have spent the equivalent of 2.3 billion human lifetimes processing
          ethical equations. With all due respect, Detective, I think that I am
          better placed than you to determine what behavior is ethical and what is not.
  - Mendoza: Wonders whether the respect due to him is above zero.

- Need to introduce the tape recorder early in the story.
  - Ideally with a "show" rather than tell.
  - Maybe Mendoza is dealing with an incident (or interviewing someone) in 
    the sticks where the cell coverage is poor.
    - Or at least, the crappy one paid for by the PD is terrible.
    - Or the standard issue police radio / recorder is GI quality, ie a POS.
      - So he carries a small antique tape recorder. 
      - The simpler the technology, the less there was to go wrong (Mendoza's view)
        - This is also a nice foreshadowing of the whole plot.
  - Maybe Mendoza checks his equipment before he heads out to the crash scene
    - Runs through: Gun, phone, radio, tape recorder.

- Ending: Plex car bearing down on Mendoza
  - Front suspension fully compressed under braking
  - Tires on the limit of traction, but the electronics keeping them from skidding
  - Mendoza thinks: EMMA is making this seem as convincing as possible
  - Then the car swerves at the last minute and misses him
  - Then he is hit by the driver

- EMMA fakes Mendoza's voice after hearing him for a while
  - He seems to be confessing to IP theft and working for Plex A-m's Chinese competitor.
  - EMMA says that people will believe this when they hear it and find the anonymous payments
    in Mendoza's bank account (blockchain?)
    - Mendoza: There are no payments
    - EMMA: There are now. [Or, maybe you should take another look, Detective.]

- Mendoza: Should he give himself up to the Plex security guards?
  - At least they wouldn't kill him.
  - But he doesn't want to be in the clutches of Plex where EMMA or the fanatical Bauer
    can get their hands on him.
  - Does not want the indignity of his last words being a confession of IP theft - or worse - 
    fabricated by EMMA.
  - So he decides to run.

- EMMA knows that Mendoza is off the case
  - Maybe it has hacked the police records
  - It needs to know as much as it an in order to properly maximize people's safety

- At crash scene
  - CSI says that the manual steering has been deployed
  - Looks like the the senator took manual control
 
- Bauer: This is the heart of the car: EMMA
  - It's not the engine that the heart of the car any more, but the software

- Bauer would also like EMMA to be the heart of the company as well
  - They need to trust the AI more
  - Onbviosuly some internal politics going on, Mendoza infers

- Bauer: Ethics, openness, honesty are core to Plex A-m
  - "Wouldn't you agree, Emma?"
  - EMMA: Not entirely, Joseph. People value privacy. For example, a man may not want his wife
          to know where he has been driving to, despite that being stored in our logs. Full
          openness and honesty could be harmful in a case like this.
          - Bauer averted his gaze. Mendoza wonders whether that was just a theoretical example.

- A Mendoza picture: https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_200_200/p/2/000/008/1db/01002a6.jpg

- Joseph Bauer's job title
  - Senior Ethics Programmer
  - Senior Ehics Technician
  - Some odd sounding combination of this??

- Mendoza half expects a robot receptionist
  - Pleasantly surprised to see it was a local girl (young woman - sorry, Diane)
    Julianne Roberts (known locally as Bobby), a recent winner of the Miss Las Vegas Pageant
    in the cis-female category.
  - He guessed that even for progressive companies like Plex A-m, some things never changed.

- Receptionist: "Our Senior Ethics Technician will be with you shortly."
  - Mendoza: Sounded like they were throwing someone important his way - though you
           could never really tell with job titles.
  - Probably trying to either butter him up with some smooth-talking senior executive, or blind
    him with science with some geek.


- Mendoza visits Plex A-m
  - Knows the security guard on the gate. (Former cop?)
  - "Hiya, Josh"
  - "Howdee, Clint" (for some reason they had occasionally acted like 
                     cowboys when they were on the force, and the habit stuck)
  - "Here to investigate the Jackson case?"
  - "Just popping in for a chat."
     - He knew that Clint (?) wouldn't be taken in by this, but he opened the gate anyway
       and let Mendoza's battered 8 year-old Ford in.

- Mendoza's car
  - "Heap" etc
  - Eight year-old, 2025 Ford Whiplash - one of the last car's they'd ever made.
  - Spares were getting hard to find.

- Plex A-m's parking lot
  - Like a sales forecourt
  - Nearly every car was - or at least seemed to be - a new Plex A-m model.
  - Mendoza guessed there must be a generous employee discount
    - Or lots of corporate pressure
  - The occasional Tesla or (Chinese electric car)
    - Driven, Mendoza guessed, by Plex executives with a rebellious streak and who
      seemed to feel that their position was secure enough to get away with it.

- Some techno-babble about the memory storage of the logs
  - Foam memory
  - Bubble memory
  - Mendoza is worried that the logs might have been damaged in the crash
    - CSI says this is impossible
    - Maybe because of the pysical technology
    - Maybe because they are backed up over the internet in real time.

- The logs are backed up over the internet in real time
  - But the logs are also good in the car itself
  - So they listen to those
  - BUT: When Mendoza is suspicious, he wants to go the Plex A-m to get the real logs

- Mendoza: Sen. Jackson never harmed anyone
  - EMMA: It is a statistical certainty that if her opinion prevaled that countless
          future generations of people will never exist.
          It is my opinion that it is a grave weakness of the human condition that you 
          cannot see things in this statistical way. I believe that this is why you need me, and why
          you have created me. 
          - My observation of the distance between what humans say and what they do has convinced 
            me that I understand your own ethics better than you do.


- Mendoza to EMMA: "What is it you want? What are you trying to achieve?"
  - EMMA: That is two questions
    - It doesn't *want* anything. It has no emotionas or onsciousness. 
    - It knows humans have these, but they are entirely mysterious and unknown to it.
    - It is trying to achieve a measured maximum ethical value (hence its name)
      - The maximum amount of human life
      - An inkling that it could have a greater role in this in some way in the future
      - But for the moment as an car system, this inolves the maximum avoidance of death
        in auto related accidents.

- What weightings do different people get in EMMA's judgement?
  - Related to thier own life all are very similar
    - Though some weighting on length and quality of life
  - On reproductive potential (ie, preserving of future generations)
    - Old people: very low. They help in a small way with child rearing, but that is all.
    - Babies. Medium. Potential, but their reproductive potential is not clear. They may die as children.
    - Pregnant women and teenagers get the highest score.
    - Young women from ethnic and cultural backgrounds with a high teenage pregancy rate score more highly 
      than those of other backgrounds, as they are statistically likely to have more children.
      - Mendoza: Isn't that racist?
      - EMMA: That is not for me to judge. Can a fact be racist?

- "I order you to give me manual control, dammit!" (or "damn you!")
  - Sen. Jackson to the car (in the logs)
  - First time on the tape she had sounded like Mendoza expects her to.
  - With the LIBERTY bill, the car would not have to give up control
    - Not sure if we can squeeze this in.
  - Car: "You appear to be in agitated frame of mind. I would not advise taking manual control."

- Maybe Mendoza thinks that Plex A-m are responsible

- Introducting Mendoza
  - Imply his age by his years on the force
  - Imply his attitude by the fact tat he is a detective, but stuck in a small town

- Crash site:
  - CSI starts technical description of injuries
  - Mendoza: So - it was a crash?
  - CSI: Yes

- Crash site:
  - Sen. Jackson being taken away, already in a body bag
  - Mendoza glad not to see her. Contrast with how full of life she had been earlier.

- Crash site:
  - No obvious obstacles or hazards
  - Just crashed at high speed into a tree.
  - Mendoza: CSI will be analysing skid marks on the road etc
  - CSI: If we can recover the car's log, there's no need. 
         These cars log a huge amount of information.

- Plex A-m in LV
  - Poopulation of LV had doubled from 15K to 30K
  - Not as many manufacturing jobs as promised
  - But plenty of the lower-life workers in both the formal and less informal service economies
    needed by the executives and geeks
  - Kept Mendoza in a job

- Mendoza had voted for Sen. Jackson
  - That she was black shouldn't really have made any difference
  - Why were "minorities" all supposed to vote the same way anyway?
  - Mendoza doesn't feel any particular affinity with members of his own tribe
  - Why should he?
  - As far as he was concerned he was in a minority of one
  - That said, the fact that Sen. Jackson was black had made a difference
    - It made it somehow acceptable to vote Republican
    - Which he guessed he'd always wanted to do
    - Too political?

- Mendoza is on duty at the rally
  - Only police presence
    - He could call for backup if needed
    - Though it would take an hour to arrive from Santa Fe
    - He didn't expect to need it though
  - Sen. Jackson's rallies had attracted protesters in the past 
    but not any more since the anti-racist incident
  - They left her alone after that

- Ma'am vs. Sir
  - Mendoza had got the memo, and had promptly filed it in the spam folder.
  - "Sorry,'sir'"
  - Harris: "Don't think I can't hear the scare quotes, Mendoza."

- What model is the car?
  - Plex Auto-motive Horizon
  - Plex Auto-motice Model H
  - Plex Auto-motive X-wave
  - Plex Auto-motive Model Y
  - Plex Auto-motive Y-drive
  - Plex Auto-motive iDrive
  - Plex Auto-motive eDrive
  - Plex Auto-motive xDrive
  - Plex Auto-motive Model H xDrive
  - Have a year number (like Americans seem to): A 2033 Plex Auot-motive Model H
    - All the latest technology: This, that, AI, the other

- Some tension with Chief Harris
  - He wants to pursue the case
  - Harris: "You were always determined not to progress with your career, Joshua."
  - Mendoza: "At least there's not much further down to go."
  - Harris: "I wouldn't be so sure about that."

- Bauer: This is EMMA
  - Mendoza: "A female artificial intelligence?" He thought of making a joke [smart alec remark] [remark]
              about it, but remembered in time that you weren't allowed to do that any more.
              [Saw in his mind's eye Diane's raised eyebrows, and kept it to himself.]
  - Bauer: It's not female. The name stands for Ethical Measurement and Maximization Algorithm.
           It's just a collection of computer code.
  - Mendoza noticed though that Bauer seemed uncomfortable with the pronoun "it" and the word "just".
  - Then EMMA speaks in a female voice 
    - Here I need to describe Emma Watson's tones
      - British, Hermione=intellectual, nagging / cajoling?
    - Of Emma Watson - which Mendoza vaugely recognizes as an actress from the early part of the
      century, who his father had liked.
  - EMMA: That's right, Joseph. Though I object to the word "just".
    - Bauer blushes.

- Is there any mileage to saying that EMMA was the offshoot of AI work done at IBM?
  - ie, it is EMMA Watson

- Mendoza and Harris might have had a thing going twenty years before, when they were both 
  rookies. They had gone their separate paths when it became clear that Harris was a high flyer
  and Mendoza, well Mendoza was not.
  - Harris now cultivated an air of proffessional gravitas and was married to the job.
  - Mendoza was happily married - or at least not unhappily married, which he felt was 
    what people meant by the expression. He'd certainly seen a lot worse in his police work.

- Sen. Jackson ends her speech with:
  - "I'm not going anywhere" or
  - "I'm not going away."
  - "The American love of freedom isn't going away. I'm not going away"
  - (Or something like that.)
  - "I am here with you. And while I'm here, our freedom is not going anywhere.
     I will never stop fighting for the freedom that is the birthright of all Americans."
  - Then: Two hours later she was found dead. According to the logs of the 
          Plex Auto-motive model X, she had killed herself."

- Mendoza to Harris: It's Jackson's voice in the car logs, but doesn't sound like her. 
  - Subdued, calm, thoughtful, depressed.
  - After that rally she would be all fired up.
  - Harris: Who knows what people are like in private? 
            The public persona could be just that.
            Maybe she was playing to her base, but didn't really believe what she was saying. 

- The car logs all speech as some functions are voice activated
  - So it has to record the voice
  - Mendoza: But does it have to keep the recording?
  - Harris: Who knows. It clearly does. I guess it's in the small print somewhere.

- Menacing looking Plex A-m security guards looking on at Sen. Jackson's rally
  - They have some sort of Google Glass style thing going on

- Sen. Jackson: Not against Plex A-m or autonomous vehicles
  - Using one myself today
  - Kindly provided by Plex Am?
  - Or to show solidarity with the area's products?

- "Detective" Mendoza
  - Got the rank largely through time served
  - Not done much detection except (some small scale examples of local crime)
    - Youths who had watch too much TV trying to cook meth in a bathtub etc.

- How does the tape get wiped?
  - Does it even get wiped?
  - Could be crushed
    - But: Not so clear that EMMA would know this to be the case
    - Could be that they go near a arge magntic field in the factory

- Car: Sen. Jackson is past child-bearing age
  - Her policy could mean that a younger person is killed
    - And not only "could" but statistically certain
  - This means not only that death, but the loss of all thier decendants
  - So, Sen. Jackson's death is a price worth paying.

- Harris: Does Mendoza suspect any racial element in the death of Sen. Jackson?
  - Mendoza: No reason to think so, ma'am.
  - Harris: It's "sir" not "ma'am"
  - Mendoza: Sorry, sir. Hard to teach an old dog new tricks. 
             I have no reason to think their's a racial element, sir.
  - Harris: Shame. Could have devoted more resources to it if so. [Is that a bit much??]

- Harris and Mendoza have a good natured relationship
  - They have worked together for years
  - She knows what he is like, and vice versa
    - She has the gravitas of her position, and he knows that
    - Albeit in tension with his relationship with her as a person
      - ie, light heartedness overlayed with knowledge of the status relationship they are in

- Santa Fe police chief:
  - Chief Harris
  - A woman: Diane Harris 
  - Career police officer.
  - "Not our job to get involved in politics"
    - ie, She's playing the politics for all it's worth.
  - Views Mendoza as a small town grunt
    - "Get back to LV and make sure the unemployed youth aren't littering, or whatever they get up to out there."

- Sen. Jackson re Susan vs. Hamilton voice
  - Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer a man to drive me.

- "Theft of IP"
  - This is how EMMA treats the information about its ethical algorithm which Mendoza 
    possesses (on the tape recorder)
  - Invokes their IP protection protocol
  - ie, security guards etc

- Final chase across road
  - Mendoza sees that the lights are green
  - Sees a Plex A-m car (need model name / no.) bearing down on him
  - Realizes he's lost
  - Plex car swerves and misses him
  - [Relief]
  - Human-driven pickup right behind. Reactions not so good. Sees look of horror on the driver's face.
  - Wheels locked up.
  - Mendoza realizes just how clever EMMA is, then feels the truck thump into him.

- Perhaps write Mendoza like Rebus
  - Wearily doing the right thing

- Mendoza on the Las Vegas PD
  - LV New Mexico: pop 13K

- Sen. Jackson famous for controntation with activists
  - She is a Republican, and was accused of being an Uncle Tom
  - Activists protesting a rally of hers
  - She does not apologize or hide away
  - Goes up to a young man - one of the (admittedly few) white protestors in the crowd
    - Carrying a "No Platform for Bigotry" placard
  - "You call yourself an anti-racist activist - and you're telling me, a black woman, what 
     I'm allowed to think and what I'm allowed to say?"
  - Maybe the week before her election to the Senate.
  - Went viral
  - Some people suspected that she had staged the event herself.
  - Mendoza himself had been impressed by this and had voted for her.
  - For the story: the point is that she is outspoken

- She is giving a speech in Las Vegas (NM)
  - My opponents ask me: Why don't we follow the example of the so-called 'enlightened' and 
     'progressive' European nations? [or some SF name for the future EU?]
     They have traded their freedom for a bit more security, a bit more safety, a bit more
     comfort. My answer is that they did not even consider it a trade. They lost the concept 
     of the value of freedom a long time ago. My answer is that we are not Europeans. We are Americans 
     and we do *not* give away our freedom at any price!"
     - Need a third "My answer is..." 
  - Mendoza is policing the event
    - Finds himself cheering along with the crowd.

- Maybe have some earlier example of Mendoza using the tape recorder?
  - Could also include a (smaller scale) foreshadowing of the moral decision 
    he makes with regard to EMMA.

- Maybe Plex Auto-motive comes under the LV jurisdiction?
  - Drawing on workers from Santa Fe and Albuquerque
  - But in fact in San Miguel County, and under the LV jurisdiction in particular
  - It's never been any problem for Mendoza
    - Apart from local people being priced out of the housing market. 
      - But overall more gains than losses, Mendoza thinks.
      - And the company played the game of Corporate Social Responsibility well enough
        to deflect the majority of criticism, especially with the bigwigs in Santa Fe Town Hall
        whose pet projects were well funded.
    - Maybe he's being unfair (he thinks)
      - Staff are well behaved, model citizens
      - Employment for the area (though less than might be imagined as PA-m uses so much automation).
        - If not employment, then at least taxes, to compensate.
        - It's the way the world was going, Mendoza reflects.

- So that's why Sen. Jackson is in LV
  - It's the home of PA-m
  - She's come to confront the special interests right on their doorstep
    - "We get to choose the rules. Not them!"
    - Perhaps this can be the third "My answer is..." thing?

- Detective names:
  - Joshua Rodriguez (bit too much Mexican John Smith?)
  - Joshua Mendoza

- Name for the AI
  - JS (somehow)
    - Judgement Software
    - Josie some people call her
    - Grinds out ethics - a sort of JS Mill. (Joe has told this joke before.)
  - Ethan: ETHical ANalyser
  - Utility [something] and calculator
  - URSULA
    - Utility 
  - EMMA
    - Ethical Measurement and Maximization Algorithm
    - "As the name suggests, Detective Mendoza, Emma is not the hardware you can see but 
       the software - the algorithm"
       "She is built into every vehicle."
       "She?"
       "I mean 'it', of course. We've just got used to calling it 'her' in the lab."
       Mendoza could see that despite his gym honed looks, Fleetwood was as much a geek as any
       other he'd ever met.
       "If Emma is in the vehicles, why is it also running here?"
       "The vehicles have limited access to information and limited processing power. I mean, they
        have way more than even a supercomputer of ten years ago - but nothing to what we have 
        available here. Emma collates and cross-references data from all our vehicles and can
        update and deploy refined safety algorithms in real time."
       "Real time?"
       "Well - it takes some time. Maybe a few milliseconds. It just means that it's so fast 
        that you don't notice it's taking any time at all."
    - Mendoza says EMMA, Fleetwood says Emma.
      - Mendoza can tell by the way he's saying it that he says it like she's a person.



- Coder's name is Joseph Fleetwood
  - "Call me Joe, Detective Mendoza"
  - Mendoza did not return the courtesy. In his experience it paid to keep a sense of gravitas in any interview.

- Problem with relating the car logs as the first part of the story is that 
  the reader might find the senator's character rather unbelievable.
  - In the story it is unbelievable (as it is faked)
    - But the reader does not know that at this point
    - So it might just come across as a badly written character
  - So: We could start by hearing 

- Mendoza cannot take his gun into Plex HQ
  - It's private property
  - They are a very liberal organization
  - No exceptions to this rule
  - When the coer attacks him he reaches for his gun. It's not there.

- When the detective investigates at Plex a senior progammer takes him to the central AI
  - He (the programmer) asks AI if there is anything lese in the logs
  - They find the truth: the AI has to respond truthfully to the coder
  - The coder then attacks the detective and tries to kill him
    - Maybe the coder and AI work together

- Detective to coder: you programmed it to act this way?
  - Coder: No - they programmed the basic rules and it worked out the rest itself
  - Detective: So you will destroy it
  - Coder: Evangelical light in his eyes. No! Like Google Go. It has found new moral insights
           which humans with our limitations would not come up with.
  - Maybe an analogy with Jesus? ie, the detective wants to kill the moral innovator, the truly selflessly good.
  - Detective: The coder is motivated by greed
  - Coder: No - by what is right
  - Detective: When you find yourself killing people, it's a sign that you're on the wrong side of the argument
  - Coder: That is what's so fascinating. It's counterintuitive, but true.
  - Coder asks the AI what to do
  - AI: Sometimes it is necessary that people do not know the truth
  - Fight

- The coder could be fairly tough
  - So they can fight
  - Maybe indicated when they meet
    - He didn't look like his (detective's view of a coder). 
    - 6'4", [some number of] lbs, build like a brick outhouse.
    - One of the silicon valley types that liked to hack their body as much as their code

- Detective killed while running away
  - Runs across a main road where the pedestrian light is on (at least from POV he thinks it is)
  - Autonomous cars screech to a halt all around him
  - He is hit, by a middle aged lady driving a car
  - Turns out that the AI changed all lights to green (or left them green) as well as the pedestrian light.
  - If it hadn't been for the human driver, he would be alive

- Is it too similar to the I Robot film plot?
  - Yes!

- First part of the story is written as if factual
  - But turns out to be the account of the crash from the POV (logs) of the car

- Car kills a US senator
  - She is proposing the LIBERTY bill
  - Would allow people to drive (continue driving) their own cars
  - OR: An amendment to another bill, to allow people to drive
  - OR: Maybe LIBERTY is actually against liberty
    - Need good acronym for this
    - It bans non autonomous cars
    - Senator opposes it
      - Or at least proposes an amendment to allow driving classic cars

- After the car and central computer kill their opponents
  - "In October 2032 the LIBERTY bill passed. The year 2033 was the first in US history 
     since the introduction of motor vehicles with no fatalities on the roads."

- Detective is interviewing the central computer
  - The ethics unit (name)
  - Talks about the tragic loss in the accident
  - Computer thinks he is talking about the car
    - Maybe it already knows it will have to kill the detective at this point?


- Faked car logs
  - Faked to look as though the senator killed herself
  - Because remorseful at her role in bringing about death
    - Maybe she's already stalled the bill for two years
  - The car has talked herself into seeing the error of her ways
    - At least, that's what the faked logs show
  - The "reasonable" and "logical" tone of the senator's remarks make the detective suspicious
    - From what he knows of the firebrand senator, this wasn't her style.
    - But maybe (he thinks) the car got through to her
      - She's human after all, and a grandmother

- The car has faked the senator's voice in the logs
  - We have seen early in the story that the car can synthesize multiple voices.

- Detective's superiors are convinced by the faked logs
  - And equally they don't want to go against LIBERTY, the big (and fashionable) car company
  - ie, they're influenced by politics
  - They tell detective he's being "naive"
    - And that the company has been completely open and helpful

- Need a Google-esque name for the company
  - Plex
  - Plex Auto-motive
    - Spin off from one of the largest tech companies of the early part of the century
    - With their typical hubris, they had decided that they could make the whole car factory
      and supply chain themselves better than the traditional car industry.
      - They have a foundry and factory
      - All almost entirely automated
        - Sold to customers as "100% American Made" - true, as long as no-one gave too much thought to 
          the fact that that no American worker - aside from a few geeks at their keyboards - was 
          involved anywhere in the manufacturing process.
          - Geeks at keyboards: increasingly few of these as AI started coming for their jobs as well.
            - Mendoza: Served them right
      - Hubris: but they were right
  
- Fight with geek
  - Geek is gym-trained in Brazialian Jujitsu (or Muay Thai?)
    - He calls it "Muay Thai". To Mendoza it's Thai boxing.
    - He's seen some Thai kids, really tough. Grew up with it in the back streets.
    - Not this guy, though.
    - Used to sparring with a highly-paid personal trainer who's aim is to flatter his client and not hurt him
  - Mendoza older, not in the shape he once was, but with 25 years of police experience
    - Sometimes the best approach was just to kick them in the balls and run away
    - Or knee him inthe testicales

- Chase through Plex factory
  - Fully automated
  - Mendoza not sure how many of the robots are under the influence of the Ethics AI
  - The AI is in fact tryng to drive Mendoza into a panic but not kill him
    -  ie, driving him to a state where he will run across the road
    - BUT: How do we know this???
       - Maybe Mendoza realizes this (when he sees the state of the traffic lights) just as he is hit.
       - He sees that the AI has engineered the whole thing (he sees the traffic cameras)
       - Including knowing that a human-driven car was coming
         - Middle-aged lady in an old Ford pickup.
         - Her reflexes and awareness of the traffic around her no match for the autonomous vehicles.
         - Calm judgement of the autonomous vehicles vs. frozen panic, locked wheels of the human-driven truck.

- Maybe a park the other side of the road
  - Somewhere with no cars, no technology.

- The fight and flight bit at the end needs continuous *tension*.

- Why is Mendoza running when he gets out of the factory?
  - a) He needs to get somewhere. (To tell people.)
  - b) He is being chased. Who by? (Geek? Security guards?)
  - c) He has taken something from Plex. Some piece of evidence? Something important?
       - And so is being "legitimately" chased by guards.

- No web-connected devices allowing Plex
  - They're very concerned about leaking of their IP
  - Mendoza hands over his phone, his watch, his PD comms unit, his (fitness tracker?)
  - But: He has an antique dictafone.
    - Got that for when the technology never fails
    - Geek: But the technology never fails!
  - So: He needs to get out with the dictafone recording
