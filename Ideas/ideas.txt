Cougar time loop
----------------
- Chap meets and marries an older woman
- He gets older and she dies.
- He is heartbroken
- He remembers their time together when he was younger and would do anything to have it back.
- He has a sex change and goes back in time
- (S)he is the older woman
- Could be rather romantic!
- He finds the instructions for the time machine in her will (ie, time loop)
- Thoughts early in the story about how you can never really see things from another person's point of view.


Sawn in half
------------
- Magician's assistant is murdered.
- We are led to think that she (he?) was sawn in half on stage
  - Maybe drugged
  - Act is gruesome / gothic themed
- Magician framed by someone else
  - Or maybe he relly did do it live
  - a. Looks like he did it
  - b. Looks like he was framed
  - c. He did do it on stage
- Perhaps the magician claims that he never knew how the trick worked.
  - He just saws her in half, and then she is back together again.
  - But one time sh was not.
- Magician is a woman, assistant a man?


I love my wife
--------------
- Man not getting enough (use Gerald's quote about "One thing worse than not fancying your wife, it's fancying her."
- Wife witnesses a mugging and falls into his arms, "Life is so fragile"
- Wife witnesses a near-miss accident involving a child and falls into his arms, "Life is so precarious, so unfair"
- Husband gets the idea that he gets some when his wife feels this way
- He starts arranging the incidents, which then have to escalate as she gets more jaded
- It gets increasingly stressful for him (problem getting it up?)
- Endings:
  - He plans to kill her sister, but accidentally kills her. Sister falls into his arms, "Life is so fragile" (Sister could be hotter, but he always resented her.)
  - He confides in a friend, who kills him. Sees wife fall into friend's arms with dying breath. 
  - Wife finds out and has him put in prison. Then moves onto next man to do the same. She had manipulated him all along.


Reinforced glass window
-----------------------



Sci-fi vs. Western

Silent Hemisphere
-----------------
- People create AI implants
- They become companions

- It turns out that this happened a long time ago
  - This is what is going on with the "silent hemisphere" of the brain.


Blink teleportation

Divorce Lawyer
--------------
- Woman confides in family friend about her brutish husband
- One thing leads to another and they end up in bed
- When they're done, the lawyer serves divorce papers


Blowing up the multiverse
-------------------------
- Different versions of Professor Karl Uffenheimer (in different parallel universes)
  end up blowing up their world with inflationary experiments.
- Dino-Uffenheimer realizes what is going on, and tries to stop it
- Other Uffenheimers also realize (do they collaborate somehow?)
- The nexus / juntion is our Earth. If they can stop this, then the chain reaction will stop
- A number of unlikely Uffenheimers materialize in the lab
  - Female, squiddy, t-rex
- Dino-Uffeneheimer eats the "snack mammal" carelessly left in the lab by the Professor
  - Then realizes that he cannot stop the countdown. His claws cannot operate the computer.
  - Picking his teeth with the arm of the snack animal, he realizes what has happened.
- POV of last scene is tricky
  - It needs to be Dino-Uffenheimer. But we need to know that the others have arrived.
