Sawn in half
------------
- Magician's assistant is murdered.
- We are led to think that she (he?) was sawn in half on stage
  - Maybe drugged
  - Act is gruesome / gothic themed
- Magician framed by someone else
  - Or maybe he relly did do it live
  - a. Looks like he did it
  - b. Looks like he was framed
  - c. He did do it on stage
- Perhaps the magician claims that he never knew how the trick worked.
  - He just saws her in half, and then she is back together again.
  - But one time sh was not.
- Magician is a woman, assistant a man?


I love my wife
--------------
- Man not getting enough (use Gerald's quote about "One thing worse than not fancying your wife, it's fancying her."
- Wife witnesses a mugging and falls into his arms, "Life is so fragile"
- Wife witnesses a near-miss accident involving a child and falls into his arms, "Life is so precarious, so unfair"
- Husband gets the idea that he gets some when his wife feels this way
- He starts arranging the incidents, which then have to escalate as she gets more jaded
- It gets increasingly stressful for him (problem getting it up?)
- Endings:
  - He plans to kill her sister, but accidentally kills her. Sister falls into his arms, "Life is so fragile" (Sister could be hotter, but he always resented her.)
  - He confides in a friend, who kills him. Sees wife fall into friend's arms with dying breath. 
  - Wife finds out and has him put in prison. Then moves onto next man to do the same. She had manipulated him all along.

Sci-fi vs. Western

- Delivery of an important message
- Obstacles:
  - Natural: Radiation cloud vs. storm

Silent Hemisphere
-----------------
- People create AI implants
- They become companions
- They take over their hosts
- They suppress the original host
- It turns out that this happened a long time ago
  - This is what is going on with the "silent hemisphere" of the brain.


Blink teleportation
-------------------
- You close your eyes, and when you open them you are somewhere else.
- Continuation of consciousness, but not of surroundings.
